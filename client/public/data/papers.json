    "Abstract": "Control settings are abundant and have significant effects on user experiences. One example of an impactful but understudied area is feed settings. In this study, we investigated awareness, navigation, and use of feed settings. We began by creating a taxonomy of feed settings on social media and search sites. Via an online survey, we measured awareness of Facebook feed settings. An in-person interview study then investigated how people navigated to and chose to set feed settings on their own feeds. We discovered that many participants did not believe ad personalization feed settings existed. Furthermore, we discovered a misalignment in the expectation and the function of settings, especially of ad personalization settings for many participants. Despite all participants struggling to find at least one setting, participants overall wanted to use settings: 94% altered at least one setting they encountered. From these results, we discuss implications and suggest design guidelines for settings.",

    "Abstract": "Social media provides a critical communication platform for political figures, but also makes them easy targets for harassment. In this paper, we characterize users who adversarially interact with political figures on Twitter using mixed-method techniques. The analysis is based on a dataset of 400 thousand users' 1.2 million replies to 756 candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives in the two months leading up to the 2018 midterm elections. We show that among moderately active users, adversarial activity is associated with decreased centrality in the social graph and increased attention to candidates from the opposing party. When compared to users who are similarly active, highly adversarial users tend to engage in fewer supportive interactions with their own party's candidates and express negativity in their user profiles. Our results can inform the design of platform moderation mechanisms to support political figures countering online harassment.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, social media services have been leveraged to spread fake news stories. Helping people spot fake stories by marking them with credibility indicators could dissuade them from sharing such stories, thus reducing their amplification. We carried out an online study (N = 1,512) to explore the impact of four types of credibility indicators on people's intent to share news headlines with their friends on social media. We confirmed that credibility indicators can indeed decrease the propensity to share fake news. However, the impact of the indicators varied, with fact checking services being the most effective. We further found notable differences in responses to the indicators based on demographic and personal characteristics and social media usage frequency. Our findings have important implications for curbing the spread of misinformation via social media platforms.",

    "Abstract": "Much human-computer interaction work related to depression focuses on the population level (e.g., studying social media hashtags related to depression) or evaluates prototypes for digital interventions to manage depression. However, little is known about how people living with depression perceive and manage technology use, such as time spent on social media per day. For this study, we interviewed 30 individuals living with depression to explore their technology and social media use. We find that these individuals demonstrated emergent practices related to self-regulation, such as learning to monitor and adjust technology use to improve their emotional, cognitive, and behavioral health. Our findings add a human-centered viewpoint to the relationship between living with depression and technology and social media use. We present design implications of these findings for better empowering individuals with depression to encourage their natural inclinations to self-regulate technology and social media use.",

This study explores how users react to fake news posts on their Facebook or Twitter feeds, as if posted by someone they follow. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 participants who use social media regularly for news, temporarily caused fake news to appear in their feeds with a browser extension unbeknownst to them, and observed as they walked us through their feeds. We found various reasons why people do not investigate low-credibility posts, including taking trusted posters' content at face value, as well as not wanting to spend the extra time. We also document people's investigative methods for determining credibility using both platform affordances and their own ad-hoc strategies. Based on our findings, we present design recommendations for supporting users when investigating low-credibility posts.",

    "Abstract": "Undisclosed online endorsements on social media can be misleading to users who may not know when viewed content contains advertisements. Despite federal regulations requiring content creators to disclose online endorsements, studies suggest that less than 10% do so in practice. To overcome this issue, we need knowledge of how to best detect online endorsements, knowledge about how prevalent online endorsements are in the wild, and ways to design systems to automatically disclose advertising content to viewers. To that end, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a tool called AdIntuition which automatically discloses when YouTube videos contain affiliate marketing, a type of social media endorsement. We evaluated AdIntuition with 783 users using a survey, field deployment, and diary study. We discuss our findings and recommendations for future measurements of and tools to detect and alert users about affiliate marketing content.",

    "Abstract": "Many studies examining social media use rely on self-report survey questions about how much time participants spend on social media platforms. Because they are challenging to answer accurately and susceptible to various biases, these self-reported measures are known to contain error -- although the specific contours of this error are not well understood. This paper compares data from ten self-reported Facebook use survey measures deployed in 15 countries (N = 49,934) against data from Facebook's server logs to describe factors associated with error in commonly used survey items from the literature. Self-reports were moderately correlated with actual Facebook use (r = 0.42 for the best-performing question), though participants significantly overestimated how much time they spent on Facebook and underestimated the number of times they visited. People who spent a lot of time on the platform were more likely to misreport their time, as were teens and younger adults, which is notable because of the high reliance on college-aged samples in many fields. We conclude with recommendations on the most accurate ways to collect time-spent data via surveys.",

    "Abstract": "We use personality theory to compare self-presentation between multiple Instagram accounts, investigating authenticity and consistency. Many studies claim social media promote inauthentic self-presentation focused on socially desirable traits. At the same time, affordances suggest that self-presentation should be relatively consistent within one social medium. For 88 participants, we examine personality traits for 'real Instagram' ('Rinsta') versus 'fake Instagram' ('Finsta') accounts, comparing these with people's offline traits using mixed-methods. Counterintuitively, we find Finsta accounts often present socially undesirable traits. Furthermore, different accounts on the same social medium reveal quite different styles of self-presentation. Overall Finstas are more Extraverted, less Conscientious, and less Agreeable than Rinstas, although equally Neurotic as offline. Interviews indicate trait differences arise from differing audience perceptions. A large anonymous Rinsta audience promotes a carefully curated self. In contrast, a small but trusted Finsta audience can engender more authentic, but negative self-presentation. We discuss design and theory implications.",

Would-be hikers leverage institutional knowledge from literature and online forums to physically and mentally prepare for such an arduous hike. Their use of social platforms provide useful insights on motivations for undertaking the thru-hike, how they deal with unexpected conditions on the trail and understand choices made in conditions of scarcity. By analyzing over 100,000 Reddit posts and comments in r/AppalachianTrail and applying a Sense of Community theory, we sought to understand hikers' identity as community members, how their emotional and practical needs are met, and how they evolve. We found that the role and language of thru-hikers change as they progress from pre-hike, on-hike, and post-hike stages, from a questioner early on, to an expert post-hike.

    "Abstract": "With nearly two billion users, social media Stories-an ephemeral format of sharing-are increasingly popular and projected to overtake sharing via public feeds. Sharing via Stories differs from Feeds sharing by removing the visible feedback (e.g. \"likes\" and \"comments\") which has come to characterize social media. Given the salience of responses visibility to self-presentation and relational maintenance in social media literature, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 22) to explore how people understand these processes when using Stories. We find that users have lower expectations for responses with Stories and experience lower pressure for self-presentation. This fosters more frequent sharing and a sense of daily connectedness, which strong ties can find valuable. Finally, the act of viewing takes on new significance of signaling attention when made known to the sharer. Our findings point to the importance of effort and attention in understanding responses on social media.",

    "Abstract": "Among many young people, the creation of a finsta-a portmanteau of \"fake\" and \"Instagram\" which describes secondary Instagram accounts-provides an outlet to share emotional, low-quality, or indecorous content with their close friends. To study why people create and maintain finstas, we conducted a qualitative study through interviews with finsta users and content analysis of video bloggers exposing their finsta on YouTube. We found that one way that young people deal with mounting social pressures is by reconfiguring online platforms and changing their purposes, norms, expectations, and currencies. Carving out smaller spaces accessible only to close friends allows users the opportunity for a more unguarded, vulnerable, and unserious performance. Drawing on feminist theory, we term this process intimate reconfiguration. Through this reconfiguration finsta users repurpose an existing and widely-used social platform to create opportunities for more meaningful and reciprocal forms of social support.",

    "Abstract": "People compare themselves to one another both offline and online. The specific online activities that worsen social comparison are partly understood, though much existing research relies on people recalling their own online activities post hoc and is situated in only a few countries. To better understand social comparison worldwide and the range of associated behaviors on social media, a survey of 38,000 people from 18 countries was paired with logged activity on Facebook for the prior month. People who reported more frequent social comparison spent more time on Facebook, had more friends, and saw proportionally more social content on the site. They also saw greater amounts of feedback on friends' posts and proportionally more positivity. There was no evidence that social comparison happened more with acquaintances than close friends. One in five respondents recalled recently seeing a post that made them feel worse about themselves but reported conflicting views: half wished they hadn't seen the post, while a third felt very happy for the poster. Design opportunities are discussed, including hiding feedback counts, filters for topics and people, and supporting meaningful interactions, so that when comparisons do occur, people are less affected by them.",

    "Abstract": "Social signals are crucial when we decide if we want to interact with someone online. However, social signals are typically limited to the few that platform designers provide, and most can be easily manipulated. In this paper, we propose a new idea called synthesized social signals (S3s): social signals computationally derived from an account's history, and then rendered into the profile. Unlike conventional social signals such as profile bios, S3s use computational summarization to reduce receiver costs and raise the cost of faking signals. To demonstrate and explore the concept, we built Sig, an extensible Chrome extension that computes and visualizes S3s. After a formative study, we conducted a field deployment of Sig on Twitter, targeting two well-known problems on social media: toxic accounts and misinformation. Results show that Sig reduced receiver costs, added important signals beyond conventionally available ones, and that a few users felt safer using Twitter as a result. We conclude by reflecting on the opportunities and challenges S3s provide for augmenting interaction on social platforms.",

This news environment has naturally suffered from challenges related to mis- and dis-information, encumbered by an increasingly complex landscape of factors and players including social media services, fact-checkers, censorship policies, and astroturfing. Interviews with 44 Chinese WeChat users were conducted to understand how individuals perceive misinformation and how it impacts their news consumption practices. Overall, this work exposes the diverse attitudes and coping strategies that Chinese users employ in complex social media environments. Due to the complex nature of censorship in China and participants' lack of understanding of censor-ship, they expressed varied opinions about its influence on the credibility of online information sources. Further, although most participants claimed that their opinions would not be easily swayed by astroturfers, many admitted that they could not effectively distinguish astroturfers from ordinary Internet users. Participants' inability to make sense of comments found online lead many participants to hold pro-censorship attitudes: the Government's Dividend.",

People's attitudes towards emotion recognition and the harms and outcomes they associate with it are important yet unknown. Focusing on social media, we interviewed 13 adult U.S. social media users to fill this gap. We find that people view emotions as insights to behavior, prone to manipulation, intimate, vulnerable, and complex. Many find emotion recognition invasive and scary, associating it with autonomy and control loss. We identify two categories of emotion recognition's risks: individual and societal. We discuss findings' implications for algorithmic accountability and argue for considering emotion data as sensitive. Using a Science and Technology Studies lens, we advocate that technology users should be considered as a relevant social group in emotion recognition advancements.",

We explore whether shrinking, one decaying representation, influences managers' assessments and simulated hiring decisions of job candidates, compared to seeing a full profile or an empty profile with no posts. Our 3 x 2 between-subjects crowdsourced survey (N = 360 US managers) shows that shrunk or empty profiles led to more positive decisions than profiles in their original full format. However, shrunk profiles also further contributed to more positive impressions of the candidates. Shrinking did not help the candidate of either gender more than the other and demographics of managers had limited impact on their assessment. Further, our managers regularly search job candidates' social media profiles in real life, suggesting that shrinking could support users' privacy. We finally present implications for individuals' privacy on social media.",

We look at three exemplar projects in three distinct domains that have successfully coordinated participation through the configuration and augmentation of existing social media technologies: participatory future forecasting, participatory health research, and connectivist learning. In this paper we conceptualise social media technologies as material for design, that is, as the raw material with which coordinated participation is realized. From this we develop a model that proposes four material qualities of social media technologies, morphology, role, representation of activity and permeability, and point to how they can be productively employed in the design of coordination of participation.",

This persistence of posts over time can be problematic, as users' self-presentation goals and network composition change, but old content remains. In this paper, we explore an alternative feature that provides control over content persistence. We present findings from interviews with 16 users of the popular Chinese social media platform WeChat Moments. We focused on Moments' Time Limit setting, which makes social media data ephemeral to audiences, but persistent to posters. Interviewees described changes in their self-presentation goals and social network composition over time and reported the Time Limit feature helped them effortlessly manage their desired self-presentation as they matured. Drawing on these findings, we discuss design implications for social media to facilitate greater control over content visibility and persistence, which may have significant benefits for social media users with large and diverse networks.",

However, many existing platform governance structures lack formal processes for democratic participation by users of the platform. Drawing inspiration from constitutional jury trials in many legal systems, this paper proposes digital juries as a civics-oriented approach for adjudicating content moderation cases. Building on existing theoretical models of jury decision-making, we outline a 5-stage model characterizing the space of design considerations in a digital jury process. We implement two examples of jury designs involving blind-voting and deliberation. From users who participate in our jury implementations, we gather informed judgments of the democratic legitimacy of a jury process for content moderation. We find that digital juries are perceived as more procedurally just than existing common platform moderation practices, but also find disagreement over whether jury decisions should be enforced or used as recommendations.",

    "Name": "Fragile Masculinity: Men, Gender, and Online Harassment",
    "Abstract": "Harassment is a persistent problem in contemporary online environments, with women disproportionately experiencing its most severe forms. While critical scholars posit that online gender harassment may be linked to men's anxieties about fulfilling normative masculine gender roles, this relationship has not been examined by empirical research. We survey 264 young men between the ages of 18-24 about their masculinity anxieties and their perceptions of harassment directed at a woman on Twitter. We find that men who perceive themselves as less masculine than average men report higher endorsement of harassment. Further, we find that the relationship between masculinity anxieties and harassment endorsement is mediated by men's adherence to masculine norms and toxic disinhibition. We interpret these results through the lens of social media's specific affordances, and we discuss their implications for technology designers and other practitioners who wish to better detect, prevent, and remediate online harassment by accounting for the role of gender.",

    "Abstract": "We conducted a thematic content analysis of 4,180 posts by adolescents (ages 12-17) on an online peer support mental health forum to understand what and how adolescents talk about their online sexual interactions. Youth used the platform to seek support (83%), connect with others (15%), and give advice (5%) about sexting, their sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and explicit content. Females often received unwanted nudes from strangers and struggled with how to turn down sexting requests from people they knew. Meanwhile, others who sought support complained that they received unwanted sexual solicitations while doing so-to the point that adolescents gave advice to one another on which users to stay away from. Our research provides insight into the online sexual experiences of adolescents and how they seek support around these issues. We discuss how to design peer-based social media platforms to support the well-being and safety of youth.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we investigate whether and how the presence of political hashtags in social media news articles influences the way people discuss news content. Specifically, we examine how political hashtags in news posts act as a design characteristic that affects the quality of online discourse. We use a randomized control experiment to assess how the presence versus absence of political hashtags (particularly the most prevalently used #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter) in social media news posts shapes discourse across a general audience (n=3205). Key findings show differences in topical focus, emotional tone of discourse, and rhetorical styles between commenters who were shown news posts with political hashtags versus those shown news posts without the hashtags. Compared to the control group, those shown hashtagged news posts heavily focus on the politics of the hashtag, use more words associated with fear, anger, and disgust in their comments, and exhibit black-and-white rhetoric and less emotionally temperate expressions in their arguments.",

    "Abstract": "How can social media platforms fight the spread of misinformation? One possibility is to use newsfeed algorithms to downrank content from sources that users rate as untrustworthy. But will laypeople be handicapped by motivated reasoning or lack of expertise, and thus unable to identify misinformation sites? And will they \"game\" this crowdsourcing mechanism in order to promote content that aligns with their partisan agendas? We conducted a survey experiment in which =984 Americans indicated their trust in numerous news sites. To study the tendency of people to game the system, half of the participants were told their responses would inform social media ranking algorithms. Participants trusted mainstream sources much more than hyper-partisan or fake news sources, and their ratings were highly correlated with professional fact-checker judgments. Critically, informing participants that their responses would influence ranking algorithms did not diminish these results, despite the manipulation increasing the political polarization of trust ratings.",

We collected two datasets that reflect participants' attitudes about content ownership, privacy, and control, one in April 2018, while Cambridge Analytica was still in the news, and another in February 2019, after the event had faded from the headlines, and aggregated the data according to participants' awareness of the story, contrasting the attitudes of those who reported the greatest awareness with those who reported the least. Participants with the greatest awareness of the news story's details have more polarized attitudes about reuse, especially the reuse of content as data. They express a heightened desire for data mobility, greater concern about networked privacy rights, increased skepticism of algorithmically targeted advertising and news, and more willingness for social media platforms to demand corrections of inaccurate or deceptive content.",

How do hate groups (or \"in-groups\"), frame their hateful agenda against the targeted group or the \"out-group?\" How do they share information? Utilizing \"framing\" theory from social movement research and analyzing domains in the shared links, we juxtapose the Facebook and Twitter communication of 72 Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated hate groups spanning five hate ideologies. Our findings show that hate groups use Twitter for educating the audience about problems with the out-group, maintaining positive self-image by emphasizing in-group's high social status, and for demanding policy changes to negatively affect the out-group. On Facebook, they use fear appeals, call for active participation in group events (membership requests), all while portraying themselves as being oppressed by the out-group and failed by the system. Our study unravels the ecosystem of cross-platform communication by hate groups, suggesting that they use Facebook for group radicalization and recruitment, while Twitter for reaching a diverse follower base.",

    "Abstract": "Showing ads delivers revenue for online content distributors, but ad exposure can compromise user experience and cause user fatigue and frustration. Correctly balancing ads with other content is imperative. Currently, ad allocation relies primarily on demographics and inferred user interests, which are treated as static features and can be privacy-intrusive. This paper uses person-centric and momentary context features to understand optimal ad-timing. In a quasi-experimental study on a three-month longitudinal dataset of 100K Snapchat users, we find ad timing influences ad effectiveness. We draw insights on the relationship between ad effectiveness and momentary behaviors such as duration, interactivity, and interaction diversity. We simulate ad reallocation, finding that our study-driven insights lead to greater value for the platform. This work advances our understanding of ad consumption and bears implications for designing responsible ad allocation systems, improving both user and platform outcomes. We discuss privacy-preserving components and ethical implications of our work.",

We use the model of unplatformed design to structure a multi-phase design process of a WhatsApp-based peer support system, with and for participants undergoing extreme weight loss as part of a health care intervention into diabetes management. From a mixed-methods evaluation of a three-month deployment of the system and reflections upon the design process we explore the value of the model in facilitating the expression of authentic peer support, and identify how the unique characteristics of unplatformed design allowed for the creation of a peer support system that was responsive to participants’ existing everyday use of social media technologies.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the human ability to distinguish political social bots from humans on Twitter. Following motivated reasoning theory from social and cognitive psychology, our central hypothesis is that especially those accounts which are opinion-incongruent are perceived as social bot accounts when the account is ambiguous about its nature. We also hypothesize that credibility ratings mediate this relationship. We asked N = 151 participants to evaluate 24 Twitter accounts and decide whether the accounts were humans or social bots. Findings support our motivated reasoning hypothesis for a sub-group of Twitter users (those who are more familiar with Twitter): Accounts that are opinion-incongruent are evaluated as relatively more bot-like than accounts that are opinion-congruent. Moreover, it does not matter whether the account is clearly social bot or human or ambiguous about its nature. This was mediated by perceived credibility in the sense that congruent profiles were evaluated to be more credible resulting in lower perceptions as bots.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding how and why people share negative emotions and thoughts on social media has received much scholarly attention. Scholars have identified a variety of factors that affect disclosure behavior, but as platforms offer a wider range of affordances that enable more diverse user behaviors and nuanced audience segmentation, these influencing factors are increasingly intertwined. However, little is known about the interrelatedness of platform, affordance, and audience. Drawing on survey data of 470 American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines the interplay and relative strength of the factors influencing distress disclosure on social media. We introduce the concept of social media disclosure ecology as an analytical lens to understand online disclosure. The results suggest that perceived affordances (i.e., anonymity, persistence, visibility control) and relational closeness to audience separately and interactively predict the depth of distress disclosure, which in turn affects satisfaction with disclosure. This study contributes to the literature on online-disclosure and privacy, while providing implications for the design of social media to better support people in distress.",

Driven by the emerging field of Human-Food Interaction and novel phenomena on social media such as Finstas, ASMR, Mukbang and live streaming, we would like to highlight the significance of food influencers as influential content creators and their social media practices. We have conducted a qualitative interview study and analyzed over 1,500 posts of food content creators on Instagram, focusing on practices of content creation, photography, staging, posting, and use of technology. Based on our findings, we have derived a process model that outlines the practices of this rather small, but influential user group. We contribute to the field of HCI by outlining the practices of food influencers as influential content creators within the social media sphere to open up design spaces for interaction researchers and practitioners.",

We investigate (non)disclosure of pregnancy loss among LGBTQ people to known ties on identified social media as well as what constitutes ideal socio-technical disclosure environments. LGBTQ persons experiencing loss face intersectional stigma for holding a marginalized sexual and/or gender identity and experiencing pregnancy loss. We interviewed 17 LGBTQ people in the U.S. who used social media and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. We demonstrate how the Disclosure Decision-Making (DDM) framework explains LGBTQ pregnancy loss (non)disclosure decisions, thereby asserting the framework's ability to explain (non)disclosure decisions for those facing intersectional stigma. We illustrate how one's LGBTQ identity shapes (non)disclosure decisions of loss. We argue that social media platforms can better facilitate disclosures about silenced topics by enabling selective disclosure, enabling proxy content moderation, providing education about silenced experiences, and prioritizing such disclosures in news feeds. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.",

However, a limited understanding of how and what life events are disclosed (or not) prevents designing platforms to be sensitive to life events. We ask what life events individuals disclose on a 256 participants’ year-long Facebook dataset of 14K posts against their self-reported life events. We contribute a codebook to identify life event disclosures and build regression models on factors explaining life events’ disclosures. Positive and anticipated events are more likely, whereas significant, recent, and intimate events are less likely to be disclosed on social media. While all life events may not be disclosed, online disclosures can reflect complementary information to self-reports. Our work bears practical and platform design implications in providing support and sensitivity to life events.",

Yet, past studies have questioned its effectiveness for the recruitment of lower-waged workers. It is also unclear whether or how employers leverage social media in their recruitment of low-wage job seekers, and how social media could better support the needs of both stakeholders. Therefore, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with employers of low-wage workers in the U.S. We found that employers: use social media, primarily Facebook, to access large pools of active low-wage job seekers; and recognize indirect signals about low-wage job seekers’ commitment and job readiness. Our work suggests that there remains a visible, yet unaddressed power imbalance between low-wage workers and employers in the use of social media, which risks further destabilizing the precarious labor market.",

Defying public health officials, coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data visualizations showing that the government’s pandemic response was excessive and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of data-driven decision-making used by experts, but to advocate for radical policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro- and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in public life.",

However, we still lack a clear understanding of how people come to identify with these new roles and how individual professional development is digitally mediated. This paper presents a study based on Bilibili, a popular Chinese social media platform featuring user-generated videos, and highlights a professionalization process through which individuals consciously distinguish between the roles of uploaders and consumers, develop a shared work ethos around the role of the uploader, and, as uploaders, improve their technical-professional expertise. We conclude by discussing individualized professionalization as a concept that describes the bottom-up and community-based process of professional development for User Generated Content (UGC) taking place in contemporary digital media environments.",

    "Name": "“I Don’t Even Remember What I Read”: How Design Influences Dissociation on Social Media",
    "Abstract": "Many people have experienced mindlessly scrolling on social media. We investigated these experiences through the lens of normative dissociation: total cognitive absorption, characterized by diminished self-awareness and reduced sense of agency. To explore user experiences of normative dissociation and how design affects the likelihood of normative dissociation, we deployed Chirp, a custom Twitter client, to 43 U.S. participants. Experience sampling and interviews revealed that sometimes, becoming absorbed in normative dissociation on social media felt like a beneficial break. However, people also reported passively slipping into normative dissociation, such that they failed to absorb any content and were left feeling like they had wasted their time. We found that designed interventions–including custom lists, reading history labels, time limit dialogs, and usage statistics–reduced normative dissociation. Our findings demonstrate that interaction designs intended to capture attention likely do so by harnessing people’s natural inclination to seek normative dissociation experiences. This suggests that normative dissociation may be a more productive framing than addiction for discussing social media overuse.",

    "Name": "“I Will Not Drink With You Today”: A Topic-Guided Thematic Analysis of Addiction Recovery on Reddit",
    "Abstract": "Recovery from addiction is a journey that requires a lifetime of support from a strong network of peers. Many people seek out this support through online communities, like those on Reddit. However, as these communities developed outside of existing aid groups and medical practice, it is unclear how they enable recovery. Their scale also limits researchers’ ability to engage through traditional qualitative research methods. To study these groups, we performed a topic-guided thematic analysis that used machine-generated topic models to purposively sample from two recovery subreddits: r/stopdrinking and r/OpiatesRecovery. We show that these communities provide access to an experienced and accessible support group whose discussions include consequences, reflections, and celebrations, but that also play a distinct metacommunicative role in supporting formal treatment. We discuss how these communities can act as knowledge sources to improve in-person recovery support and medical practice, and how computational techniques can enable HCI researchers to study communities at scale.",

    "Abstract": "We present a qualitative study with 36 diverse social media users in India to critically examine how low-resource communities engage with fake videos, including cheapfakes and AI-generated deepfakes. We find that most users are unaware of digitally manipulated fake videos and perceive videos to be fake only when they present inaccurate information. Few users who know about doctored videos expect them to be of poor quality and know nothing about sophisticated deepfakes. Moreover, most users lack the skills and willingness to spot fake videos and some were oblivious to the risks and harms of fake videos. Even when users know a video to be fake, they prefer to take no action and sometimes willingly share fake videos that favor their worldview. Drawing on our findings, we discuss design recommendations for social media platforms to curb the spread of fake videos.",

We surveyed 135 creators to understand their personal experiences with attacks (including toxic comments, impersonation, stalking, and more), the coping practices they employ, and gaps they experience with existing solutions (such as moderation or reporting). We find that while a majority of creators view audience interactions favorably, nearly every creator could recall at least one incident of hate and harassment, and attacks are a regular occurrence for one in three creators. As a result of hate and harassment, creators report self-censoring their content and leaving platforms. Through their personal stories, their attitudes towards platform-provided tools, and their strategies for coping with attacks and harms, we inform the broader design space for how to better protect people online from hate and harassment.",

    "Abstract": "Social media has witnessed an unprecedented growth in users based in low-income communities in the Global South. However, much remains unknown about the drivers of misinformation in such communities. To fill this gap, we conducted an interview-based study to examine how rural and urban communities in India engage with misinformation on WhatsApp. We found that misinformation led to bitterness and conflict – rural users who had higher social status heavily influenced the perceptions and engagement of marginalized members. While urban users relied on the expertise of gatekeepers for verification, rural users engaged in collective deliberations in offline spaces. Both rural and urban users knowingly forwarded misinformation. However, rural users propagated hyperlocal misinformation, whereas urban users forwarded misinformation to reduce their efforts to assess information credibility. Using a public sphere lens, we propose that the reactions to misinformation provide a view of Indian society and its schisms around class, urbanity, and social interactions.",

While play has long been of interest to the HCI community, research has often focused on the technologies supporting game play, the potential outcomes of play (e.g., skill-building, health improvements), or play among children. This paper explores what play looks like in online communities that are not specifically game-based and consist primarily of adults. From online ethnographic work of the ARMY (i.e., Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), fandom of the South Korean musical group BTS, we explore how BTS and ARMY collaboratively construct a playful social environment using various social media platforms. A contribution of this work is to expand our conceptualization of how adults create playful places that are not specifically game-based and highlights the role of socio-technical systems in their community building.",

    "Abstract": "There is a great deal of interest in the role that partisanship, and cross-party animosity in particular, plays in interactions on social media. Most prior research, however, must infer users’ judgments of others’ posts from engagement data. Here, we leverage data from Birdwatch, Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking pilot program, to directly measure judgments of whether other users’ tweets are misleading, and whether other users’ free-text evaluations of third-party tweets are helpful. For both sets of judgments, we find that contextual features – in particular, the partisanship of the users – are far more predictive of judgments than the content of the tweets and evaluations themselves. Specifically, users are more likely to write negative evaluations of tweets from counter-partisans; and are more likely to rate evaluations from counter-partisans as unhelpful. Our findings provide clear evidence that Birdwatch users preferentially challenge content from those with whom they disagree politically. While not necessarily indicating that Birdwatch is ineffective for identifying misleading content, these results demonstrate the important role that partisanship can play in content evaluation. Platform designers must consider the ramifications of partisanship when implementing crowdsourcing programs.",

This reporting is challenging, and journalists fill gaps in their expertise by utilizing external resources, including academic researchers. This paper discusses how journalists work with researchers to report on online misinformation. Through an ethnographic study of thirty collaborations, including participant-observation and interviews with journalists and researchers, we identify five types of collaborations and describe what motivates journalists to reach out to researchers — from a lack of access to data to support for understanding misinformation context. We highlight challenges within these collaborations, including misalignment in professional work practices, ethical guidelines, and reward structures. We end with a call to action for CHI researchers to attend to this intersection, develop ethical guidelines around supporting journalists with data at speed, and offer practical approaches for researchers filling a “data mediator” role between social media and journalists.",

To gain a better understanding of experiences that are unique to autistic college students, we conducted a mixed-method study with 20 students (10 autistic and 10 neurotypical). We collected physiological, contextual, experience, and environmental data from their natural environment using Fitbit and smartphones. We found that stress patterns, emotional states, and physical states are similar for both groups. Our autistic participants prioritized academic success over everything else, often intentionally confining their movements among academic, resident, and work locations to engage themselves with academic work as much as possible. They had a small number of friends, always preferring quality over quantity and sometimes regarding friends as close as family members. To maintain a better social life, they extensively used social media. They slept more than neurotypical participants per day; however, they experienced lower sleep quality.",

In our focus groups, participants (N=49) described harms they experienced through racism, misogynoir, ableism, and sexual objectification, and their complex labor of protecting and transforming their experiences online. Despite the harmful effects of unwanted behavior online, participants described a Black feminist transformative politic, in which they cultivated healing and joy through various methods offline and online. Using a transformative justice lens, we discuss their experiences of harassment from white women and men, as well as the complexities of cultural betrayal when experiencing harassment from Black men.",

Based on a seven-month-long qualitative empirical study in Dhaka, this paper reports how Facebook commerce (F-commerce) drives many local women to actively engage in home-based businesses, which in turn, challenges the inherent spatial regulations of modern residential architecture. This paper also documents how F-commerce mediated transformations in residential spaces are promoting heterogeneous functions, re-surfacing traditional values, and altering orders and rationales that define modern housing. Drawing from a rich body of literature in urban housing architecture, critical theories around modernism, South-Asian feminism, and postcolonial computing, we explain how these spatial transformations and alterations are “appropriating” architectural design vocabularies. Our findings further explain how negligence toward such emerging needs often marginalizes the women spatially and economically, who are involved in F-commerce. We conclude with design implications to architecture and HCI to address these issues, and connect our findings to the broader agendas of Postcolonial HCI around diversity, inclusion, and global development.",

    "Name": "Impact of Out-of-Vocabulary Words on the Twitter Experience of Blind Users",
    "Abstract": "Most people who are blind interact with social media content with the assistance of a screen reader, a software that converts text to speech. However, the language used in social media is well-known to contain several informal out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., abbreviations, wordplays, slang), many of which do not have corresponding standard pronunciations. The narration behavior of screen readers for such out-of-vocabulary words and the corresponding impact on the social media experience of blind screen reader users are still uncharted research territories. Therefore we seek to plug this knowledge gap by examining how current popular screen readers narrate different types of out-of-vocabulary words found on Twitter, and also, how the presence of such words in tweets influences the interaction behavior and comprehension of blind screen reader users. Our investigation showed that screen readers rarely autocorrect out-of-vocabulary words, and moreover they do not always exhibit ideal behavior for certain prolific types of out-of-vocabulary words such as acronyms and initialisms. We also observed that blind users often rely on tedious and taxing workarounds to comprehend actual meanings of out-of-vocabulary words. Informed by the observations, we finally discuss methods that can potentially reduce this interaction burden for blind users on social media.",

Drawing on Rogers’ Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), this survey study explores Caribbean people’s (N=551) perceptions of safety threats and the factors contributing to their intention to adopt protective behaviors. Our analysis revealed that prior victimization was associated with increased perceptions of vulnerability and severity of harms, which, in turn, influenced elevated safety protection behaviors. For harassment-related harms in particular, participants’ trust in social media sites increased their intention to adopt protective behaviors. We observe significant country-to-country differences, which we contextualize through interviews with experts throughout the region. Our findings provide a new understanding of users’ mental models, behaviors, and attitudes with respect to online safety. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications and outline opportunities for the design of inclusive and culturally-aware safety tools.",

In this paper, we consider the moderating effect of people’s mindsets about social media — whether they think a platform is good or bad for themselves and for society more generally. Combining survey responses from 29,284 participants in 15 countries with server-logged data of Facebook use, we found that when people thought that Facebook was good for them and for society, time spent on the platform was not significantly associated with well-being. Conversely, when they thought Facebook was bad, greater time spent was associated with lower well-being. On average, there was a small, negative correlation between time spent and well-being and the causal direction is not known. Beliefs had a stronger moderating relationship when time-spent measures were self-reported rather than coming from server logs. We discuss potential mechanisms for these results and implications for future research on well-being and social media use.",

Here, we design and deploy Chirp, a mobile Twitter client, to independently examine how users experience external and internal supports. To develop Chirp, we identified 16 features that influence users’ sense of agency on Twitter through a survey of 129 participants and a design workshop. We then conducted a four-week within-subjects deployment with 31 participants. Our internal supports (including features to filter tweets and inform users when they have exhausted new content) significantly increased users’ sense of agency, while our external supports (a usage dashboard and nudges to close the app) did not. Participants valued our internal supports and said that our external supports were for “other people.” Our findings suggest that design patterns promoting agency may serve users better than screen time tools.",

While prior work has studied gender roles in greeting card messages, systematic analysis at scale and tools for raising the awareness of gender stereotyping remain under-investigated. To this end, we collect a large greeting card message corpus covering three different occasions (birthday, Valentine’s Day and wedding) from three sources (exemplars from greeting message websites, real-life greetings from social media and language model generated ones). We uncover a wide range of gender stereotypes in this corpus via topic modeling, odds ratio and Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). We further conduct a survey to understand people’s perception of gender roles in messages from this corpus and if gender stereotyping is a concern. The results show that people want to be aware of gender roles in the messages, but remain unconcerned unless the perceived gender roles conflict with the recipient’s true personality. In response, we developed GreetA, an interactive visualization and writing assistant tool to visualize fine-grained topics in greeting card messages drafted by the users and the associated gender perception scores, but without suggesting text changes as an intervention.",

In this paper, we shed light on this topic through our nine-month-long ethnographic study on the production, sharing, and consumption of Islamic sermon videos (locally known as Waz) in Bangladesh. We report how faith, informal learning, local collaboration, creativity, and care play crucial roles in creating Islamic sermon videos and their proliferation online. We discuss how the sermon videos create a religious counterpublic in Bangladesh. We further discuss how such faith-based media production makes important lessons pertinent to the national grassroots politics in the Global South, politics of social media platforms, and HCI4D scholarship.",

    "Abstract": "During crises like COVID-19, individuals are inundated with conflicting and time-sensitive information that drives a need for rapid assessment of the trustworthiness and reliability of information sources and platforms. This parallels evolutions in information infrastructures, ranging from social media to government data platforms. Distinct from current literature, which presumes a static relationship between the presence or absence of trust and people’s behaviors, our mixed-methods research focuses on situated trust, or trust that is shaped by people’s information-seeking and assessment practices through emerging information platforms (e.g., social media, crowdsourced systems, COVID data platforms). Our findings characterize the shifts in trustee (what/who people trust) from information on social media to the social media platform(s), how distrust manifests skepticism in issues of data discrepancy, the insufficient presentation of uncertainty, and how this trust and distrust shift over time. We highlight the deep challenges in existing information infrastructures that influence trust and distrust formation.",

    "Name": "Towards Conviviality in NavigatingHealth Information on Social Media",
    "Abstract": "HCI is increasingly concerned with health information quality and spread of misinformation on social media. Despite many major platforms having been adopted across the world, the situated evaluation and sharing of health information is underexplored across diverse health systems and cultural and political contexts. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we study the navigation of health information on social media in urban and rural South India, backdropped by plural knowledges around health and the specific politics and sociality of health and social media in this setting. We use Ivan Illich’s concept of tools for conviviality [49] to distinguish between how people creatively use tools versus how tools manage and impose values on people—participants aimed to use health information towards care beyond institutionalized healthcare, but insidious misinformation and information-sharing practices served to commodify, spark uncertainty in, and discipline caring behavior. We use our findings to expand understandings of the use of health information on social media and how positionality shapes how people are affected by and respond to misinformation. We also draw attention to the structural aspects of health misinformation in the Indian context and how the design of social media platforms might play a role in addressing it.",

    "Abstract": "Changing a Twitter account’s privacy setting between public and protected changes the visibility of past tweets. By inspecting the privacy setting of more than 100K Twitter users over 3 months, we noticed that over 40% of those users changed their privacy setting at least once with around 16% changing it over 5 times. This observation motivated us to explore the reasons why people switch their privacy settings. We studied these switching phenomena quantitatively by comparing the tweeting behaviour of users when public vs protected, and qualitatively using two follow-up surveys (n=100, n=324) to understand potential reasoning behind the observed behaviours. Our quantitative analysis shows that users who switch privacy settings mention others and share hashtags more when their setting is public. Our surveys highlighted that users turn protected to share personal content and regulate boundaries while they turn public to interact with others in ways the protected setting prevents.",

    "Abstract": "Technology has provided an environment for connecting indigenous community members and provide a means for them to seek and engage with their indigenous knowledge (IK). Emerging research has examined the effects of social media on specific IK, including the possibility of undermining community agency. In this work, we contrast how indigenous community members engage with IK offline, and in their own self-organized communities online. Through interviews with community members and a study of Facebook Pages and Facebook Groups, we seek to better understand these practices and elicit design recommendations. Our findings describe how community roles have shifted in the presence of technology, notably with absence of elders and the inclusion of “born towns”–community members who live in non-traditional settings. We also find that fluency in the indigenous language served both as a gatekeeper: guarding the community knowledge, while also facilitating discussion surrounding different aspects of IK.",

    "Abstract": "Although youth increasingly communicate with peers online, we know little about how private online channels play a role in providing a supportive environment for youth. To fill this gap, we asked youth to donate their Instagram Direct Messages and filtered them by the phrase “help me.” From this query, we analyzed 82 conversations comprised of 336,760 messages that 42 participants donated. These threads often began as casual conversations among friends or lovers they met offline or online. The conversations evolved into sharing negative experiences about everyday stress (e.g., school, dating) to severe mental health disclosures (e.g., suicide). Disclosures were usually reciprocated with relatable experiences and positive peer support. We also discovered unsupport as a theme, where conversation members denied giving support, a unique finding in the online social support literature. We discuss the role of social media-based private channels and their implications for design in supporting youth’s mental health. Content Warning: This paper includes sensitive topics, including self-harm and suicide ideation. Reader discretion is advised.",

TikTok has gained notoriety for an abundance of mental health content and discourse. We present fndings from a semi-structured interview study with 16 participants about mental health content and participants’ perceptions of community on TikTok. We fnd that TikTok’s community structure is permeable, allowing for self-discovery and understanding not found in traditional online communities. However, participants are wary of mental health information due to conficts between a creator’s vulnerability and credibility. Our interviews suggest that the “For You Page\" is a runaway train that encourages diverse community and content engagement but also displays harmful content that participants feel they cannot escape. We propose design implications to support better mental health, as well as implications for social computing research on community in algorithmic landscapes.",

There is work around the design of technology for medication adherence and HIV treatment. Yet, there is still a lack of empirical research that investigates how people could cope with stigma more efectively using technology. Thus, we obtained data from co-design workshops conducted remotely from the U.S. with 25 people living with HIV. Our fndings foreground key needs and values via the discussion of features and functionality of speculative co-designed technologies that would allow people to leverage key stigma coping strategies. Based on these insights, we forward design implications for social media, which is the most common type of technology that people living with HIV currently use to cope with public stigma.",

Scholars have sought to understand social media’s role in mental health issues, but limited work has explored TikTok—the video-centric social media platform that is popular with youth—and people’s connections around psychiatric hospitalization experiences. In this study, we used qualitative content analysis to examine a random sample of 140 TikTok posts related to psychiatric hospitalization. We found that members of this population frequently utilize humor to create and maintain a positive and supportive community with each other. We also describe how TikTok’s design afords these interactions among community members, and conclude with a series of provocations for researchers and designers working at the intersections of social media and mental illness. We hope our study provides insights for how to further support rather than just censor youth in using creative outlets to connect with each other.",

We conducted 12 participatory design sessions with 20 autistic adult collaborators. Through thematic analysis of qualitative data, we identify seven challenges our participants experienced when using social media, and a set of imagined features that represent their vision of how design could better support their social media use. We discuss how mainstream social media platforms are primarily designed to address neurotypical sensitivities, and fail autistic adults through lack of user control, inadequate mechanisms for expressing tone and intention, and an orientation towards phatic interactions. To close, we outline how autistic sociality can inspire the design of kinder and more considerate social media platforms.",

Through a qualitative interview study of 22 U.S.-based OnlyFans creators, we fnd that beyond the typical motivations for pursuing gig work (e.g., fexibility, autonomy), our participants were motivated by three key factors: (1) societal visibility and mainstream acceptance of OnlyFans; (2) platform design and afordances such as boundary-setting with clients, privacy from the public, and content archives; and (3) the pandemic, as OnlyFans provided an enormous opportunity to overcome lockdown-related issues.",

This has motivated an increasing number of studies, which investigate our perceptions of these influencers. Most studies propose that VI are often rated lower in perceived trust and higher in uncanniness. Yet, we still lack a deeper understanding as to why this is the case. We conduct 2 studies: 1) a questionnaire with 150 participants to get the general perception for the included influencers, and 2) an electroencephalography (EEG) study to get insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of influencer perception. Our results support findings from related works regarding lower trust and higher uncanniness associated with VI. Interestingly, the EEG components N400 and LPP did not modulate perceived trust, but rather perceived humanness, uncanniness, and intentions to follow recommendations. This provides a fruitful beginning for future research on virtual humans.",

    "Abstract": "With the 2022 US midterm elections approaching, conspiratorial claims about the 2020 presidential elections continue to threaten users’ trust in the electoral process. To regulate election misinformation, YouTube introduced policies to remove such content from its searches and recommendations. In this paper, we conduct a 9-day crowd-sourced audit on YouTube to assess the extent of enactment of such policies. We recruited 99 users who installed a browser extension that enabled us to collect up-next recommendation trails and search results for 45 videos and 88 search queries about the 2020 elections. We find that YouTube’s search results, irrespective of search query bias, contain more videos that oppose rather than support election misinformation. However, watching misinformative election videos still lead users to a small number of misinformative videos in the up-next trails. Our results imply that while YouTube largely seems successful in regulating election misinformation, there is still room for improvement.",

Through this, the afordances of the Duet feature facilitate a distributed and collaborative creative process, in which we can observe the evolution of cultural artifacts through the diferent versions that are produced from user contributions. As a result, the open-ended nature of these collaborations positions engagement as both a creative and social act. In this paper, we identify the ways in which the Duet feature supports decentralized co-creativity and engagement between users.

Surprisingly, there is sparse research on how cultural context afects network formation and content consumption on social media. We analyzed the friendship networks and dyadic relations between content producers and consumers across 73 countries through a cultural lens in a closed-network setting. Closed networks allow for intimate bonds and self-expression, providing a natural setting to study cultural diferences in behavior. We studied three theoretical frameworks of culture - individualism, relational mobility, and tightness. We found that friendship networks formed across different cultures difer in egocentricity, meaning the connectedness between a user’s friends. Individualism, mobility, and looseness also signifcantly negatively impact how tie strength afects content consumption. Our fndings show how culture afects social media behavior, and we outline how researchers can incorporate this in their work.

However, much of the discourse on the benefts and pitfalls of moderation has so far focused on users in the West. Little is known about how users in the Global South interact with the humans and algorithms behind opaque moderation systems. To fll this gap, we conducted interviews with 19 Bangladeshi social media users who received restrictions for violating community standards on Facebook. We found that the users perceived the underlying human-AI infrastructure to imbibe coloniality in the form of amplifying power relations, centering Western norms, and perpetuating historical injustices and erasure of minoritized expressions. Based on the fndings, we establish that the current moderation systems often propagate historical power relations and patterns of oppression, and discuss ways to rethink moderation in a fundamentally decolonial way.",

Social media ofers new opportunities for people with disabilities to engage in activism while bypassing the accessibility issues involved in traditional activism. At the same time, disabled people face various forms of social and technical exclusion that may also complicate their use of social media for disability activism. To understand how disabled activists advocate for social change online, we interviewed 20 disabled content creators about their goals, strategies, and challenges around posting activism content on social media. We fnd that visibility is essential for successful online activism, but that the pursuit of visibility requires disabled content creators to navigate additional challenges including social stigma, algorithmic suppression, accessibility issues, and a heightened risk of harassment. We identify three main types of disability-related harassment faced by disabled activists, along with six ways in which they respond to such harassment. We examine the sociotechnical nature of the strategies disabled activists use to gain visibility, and identify key trade-ofs involved in mitigating harassment while engaging in activism on social media.",

To do so, we design a personalized AI which iteratively takes as training data a single user’s assessment of content and predicts how the same user would assess other content. We conduct a user study in which participants interact with a personalized AI that learns their assessments of a feed of tweets, shows its predictions of whether a user would fnd other tweets (in)accurate, and evolves according to the user feedback. We study how users perceive such an AI, and whether the AI predictions infuence users’ judgment. We fnd that this infuence does exist and it grows larger over time, but it is reduced when users provide reasoning for their assessment. We draw from our empirical observations to identify design implications and directions for future work.",

    "Name": "I Like Their Autonomy and Closeness to Me: Uncovering the Perceived Appeal of Social-Media Influencers",
    "Abstract": "The proliferation of infuencers on social-media platforms has drawn considerable research attention, particularly in the feld of marketing. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding among HCI and communication researchers of what leads these social-media infuencers’ (SMIs’) audiences to favor and choose their content over traditional media. To fll this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 45 SMI audience members. Our fndings revealed a total of eight categories of SMIs’ appeals, i.e., factors that made the interviewees favor their content over traditional media. These appeals can further be grouped into three categories: content, presentation, and closeness. In particular, we identifed the key role of SMIs’ perceived high autonomy and independence, which led both their content and their presentation styles to be seen as distinct from and more appealing than traditional media. Likewise, four closeness appeals made our participants feel emotionally attached to SMIs, resulting in sustained engagement.",

    "Name": "Less is Not More: Improving Findability and Actionability of Privacy Controls for Online Behavioral Advertising",
    "Abstract": "Tech companies that rely on ads for business argue that users have control over their data via ad privacy settings. However, these ad settings are often hidden. This work aims to inform the design of findable ad controls and study their impact on users’ behavior and sentiment. We iteratively designed ad control interfaces that varied in the setting’s (1) entry point (within ads, at the feed’s top) and (2) level of actionability, with high actionability directly surfacing links to specific advertisement settings, and low actionability pointing to general settings pages (which is reminiscent of companies’ current approach to ad controls). We built a Chrome extension that augments Facebook with our experimental ad control interfaces and conducted a between-subjects online experiment with 110 participants. Results showed that entry points within ads or at the feed’s top, and high actionability interfaces, both increased Facebook ad settings’ findability and discoverability, as well as participants’ perceived usability of them. High actionability also reduced users’ effort in finding ad settings. Participants perceived high and low actionability as equally usable, which shows it is possible to design more actionable ad controls without overwhelming users. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of regulation to provide specific and research-informed requirements to companies on how to design usable ad controls.",

We report on nine months of fieldwork with a transnational and intergovernmental organization using social media data to understand the role of grassroots initiatives in Mexico, in the unique context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We show how different stakeholders negotiate the definition of problems to be addressed with social media data, the collective creation of ground-truth, and the limitations involved in the process of extracting value from data. The meanings of social media data are not defined in advance; instead, they are contingent on the practices and needs of the organization that seeks to extract insights from the analysis. We conclude with a list of reflections and questions for researchers who mediate in the mobilization of social media data into non-profit organizations to inform humanitarian action.",

    "Abstract": "Mental health discussions on public forums infuence the perceptions of people. Negative consequences may result from hostile and “othering” portrayals of people with mental disorders. Adopting the lens of Moral Foundation Theory (MFT), we study framings of mental health discourse on Twitter and News, and how moral underpinnings abate or exacerbate stigma. We adopted a large language model based representation framework to score 13,277,115 public tweets and 21,167 news articles against MFT’s fve foundations. We found discussions on Twitter to demonstrate compassion, justice and equity-centered moral values for those sufering from mental illness, in contrast to those on News. That said, stigmatized discussions appeared on both Twitter and News, with news articles being more stigmatizing than tweets. We discuss implications for public health authorities to refne measures for safe reporting of mental health, and for social media platforms to design afordances that enable empathetic discourse.",

    "Abstract": "Online harassment is a global problem. This article examines perceptions of harm and preferences for remedies associated with online harassment with nearly 4000 participants in 14 countries around the world. The countries in this work refect a range of identities and values, with a focus on those outside of North American and European contexts. Results show that perceptions of harm are higher among participants from all countries studied compared to the United States. Non-consensual sharing of sexual photos is consistently rated as harmful in all countries, while insults and rumors are perceived as more harmful in non-U.S. countries, especially harm to family reputation. Lower trust in other people and lower trust in sense of safety in one’s neighborhood correlate with increased perceptions of harm of online harassment. In terms of remedies, participants in most countries prefer monetary compensation, apologies, and publicly revealing ofender’s identities compared to the U.S. Social media platform design and policy must consider regional values and norms, which may depart from U.S. centric-approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Social media platform success relies on users to consume, create, and share creative content. While some creatives aspire to become infuencers, this is not the goal of all creatives, particularly those with smaller audiences. Through an interview study of 15 creatives on TikTok, we explore the often overlapping intentions for creating and sharing videos, as well as the challenges to maintaining these creative intentions and routines as they are shaped by platform logic. We fnd platforms introduce impediments which disrupt people’s creative routines and alienate people from their overlapping creative intentions; introducing challenges which alienate people from their sense of self, and their audiences. We construct a broader defnition of creative labor - the work of professionalizing and monetizing a creative product shared on social media - refecting on how the routine enactment of creative labor is impacted by infrastructural elements of technology.",

While the short-form video feeds popularized by  TikTok are rapidly spreading to other platforms, we do not yet  understand their impact on cognitive functions. We conducted a  between-subjects experiment (N = 60) investigating the impact  of engaging with TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube while performing  a Prospective Memory task (i.e., executing a previously planned  action). The study required participants to remember intentions  over interruptions. We found that the TikTok condition significantly degraded the users’ performance in this task. As none of  the other conditions (Twitter, YouTube, no activity) had a similar  effect, our results indicate that the combination of short videos and  rapid context-switching impairs intention recall and execution. We  contribute a quantified understanding of the effect of social media  feed format on Prospective Memory and outline consequences for  media technology designers to not harm the users’ memory and  wellbeing.",

Social media can be a useful outlet for social participation for individuals with TBI, but there are barriers to access. While research has drawn attention to the nature of access barriers, few studies have investigated technological solutions to address these barriers, particularly considering the perspectives of individuals with TBI. To address this gap in knowledge, we used a participatory approach to engage 10 adults with TBI in conceptualizing tools to address their challenges accessing Facebook. Participants described multifaceted challenges in using social media, including interface overload, social comparisons, and anxiety over self-presentation and communication after injury. They discussed their needs and preferences and generated ideas for design solutions. Our work contributes to designing assistive and accessibility technology to facilitate an equal access to the benefts of social media for individuals with TBI.",

While much has been written about youths’ online activism, less is known about how engaging with sociopolitical content may build their capacity for activist work. We explore the extent to which youths’ engagement with sociopolitical content on various social media platforms is associated with critical consciousness—an awareness of inequities, the motivation to address them, and action that combats injustice. To investigate this relationship, we conducted a survey with 339 high school-aged youths. While sociopolitical engagement on some platforms was positively associated with youths’ critical consciousness measures, sociopolitical engagement on other platforms was negatively associated. Qualitative post-hoc analysis was used to suggest reasons for possible diferences. In light of our fndings, we discuss the relationship between online sociopolitical engagement and critical consciousness and suggest directions for future work.",

Furthermore, some users report a sense of compulsion, a decrease in mental wellbeing and an increased sense of distraction. A common complaint among users harks back to the Facebook newsfeed. In a field experiment with real Facebook users (n = 138), we investigate the difference between a strict newsfeed diet (where the newsfeed is automatically reduced to a minimum) and self-regulated newsfeed diet (where the newsfeed is reduced, but users can then manage its content). Our results indicate that both of these newsfeed diets are effective at reducing the time spent on Facebook’s platform (−64% for the strict diet, −39% for the self-regulated diet). Our findings also suggest that these design interventions come with positive and negative user experiences such as increased self-awareness and fear of missing out (FOMO).",

    "Abstract": "YouTube has many features, such as homepage recommendations, that encourage users to explore its vast library of videos. However, when users visit YouTube with a specific intention, e.g., learning how to program in Python, these features to encourage exploration are often distracting. Prior work has innovated ‘commitment interfaces’ that restrict social media but finds that they often indiscriminately block needed content. In this paper, we describe the design, development, and evaluation of an ‘adaptable commitment interface,’ the SwitchTube mobile app, in which users can toggle between two interfaces when watching YouTube videos: Focus Mode (search-first) and Explore Mode (recommendations-first). In a three-week field deployment with 46 US participants, we evaluate how the ability to switch between interfaces affects user experience, finding that it provides users with a greater sense of agency, satisfaction, and goal alignment. We conclude with design implications for how adaptable commitment interfaces can support digital wellbeing.",

    "Abstract": "Social media platforms exacerbate trauma, and many users experience various forms of trauma unique to them (e.g., doxxing and swatting). Trauma is the psychological and physical response to experiencing a deeply disturbing event. Platforms’ failures to address trauma threaten users’ well-being globally, especially amongst minoritized groups. Platform policies also expose moderators and designers to trauma through content they must engage with as part of their jobs (e.g., child sexual abuse). We consider how a traumainformed approach might help address or decrease the likelihood of (re)experiencing trauma online. A trauma-informed approach to social media recognizes that everyone likely has a trauma history and that trauma is experienced at the individual, secondary, collective, and cultural levels. This paper proceeds by detailing trauma and its impacts. We then describe how the six trauma-informed principles can be applied to social media design, content moderation, and companies. We conclude by ofering recommendations that balance platform responsibility and accountability with well-being and healing for all.",

Mothers utilize social media and online forums throughout postpartum to seek mental health support. In this paper, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics of naturally occurring online discussions and the online social support dynamics associated with PPD. We qualitatively analyze posts and comments from three postpartum depression support communities corresponding to well-known online social platforms (Reddit, What to expect, and Babycenter). We discovered that the three communities share common themes of discussion that include the causes, stressors, symptoms, and coping mechanisms for PPD. Seeking both informational and emotional support through venting and storytelling was prevalent, and emotional support seeking was more common in Reddit in than the other two communities. We provide recommendations for future postpartum depression research and design considerations based on pervasive help-seeking approaches.",

    "Abstract": "A significant share of political discourse occurs online on social  media platforms. Policymakers and researchers try to understand  the role of social media design in shaping the quality of political  discourse around the globe. In the past decades, scholarship on  political discourse theory has produced distinct characteristics of  different types of prominent political rhetoric such as deliberative,  civic, or demagogic discourse. This study investigates the relationship between social media reaction mechanisms (i.e., upvotes,  downvotes) and political rhetoric in user discussions by engaging  in an in-depth conceptual analysis of political discourse theory.  First, we analyze 155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and 2018 to explore whether users’  style of political discussion aligns with the essential components of  deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second, we perform  a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis  with difference in differences models to explore whether different reaction mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and  downvotes, no reaction mechanisms) correspond with political user  discussion that is more or less characteristic of deliberative, civic,  or demagogic discourse. We produce three main takeaways. First,  despite being “ideal constructs of political rhetoric,” we find that  political discourse theories describe political discussions on Reddit  to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums  with only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with  user discourse that is more deliberate and civic. Third, and perhaps  most strikingly, social media discussions are most demagogic in  subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the  relationship between social media interface design and respectful  political discussion among users.1",

We interviewed 40 participants from two South Asian countries, Bangladesh and India, to explore their perceptions and practices regarding targeted ads on social media platforms. Participants identifed emerging ad types, such as infuencer-based ads and soft ads, through articles. In addition, participants often outweighed discounts over product quality when viewing ads. We also observed novel user mental models of targeted ads based on mobile app permissions and excessive AI usage. Participants often preferred ad control over transparency. While most participants rarely used ad settings, some controlled ads by changing mobile app permissions or muting ads on social media platforms. Participants also raised concerns about fraudulent targeted ads and privacy violations due to device sharing. We present potential design ideas to mitigate these concerns.",

Researchers, companies, and journalists alike have increasingly investigated these questions, which are fundamental to understanding social media interactions and their implications for society. However, trust in social media is a complex concept, and there is conficting evidence about the antecedents and implications of trusting social media content, users, and platforms. More problematic is that we lack basic agreement as to what trust means in the context of social media. Addressing these challenges, we conducted a systematic review to identify themes and challenges in this feld. Through our analysis of 70 papers, we contribute a synthesis of how trust in social media is defned, conceptualized, and measured, a summary of trust antecedents in social media, an understanding of how trust in social media impacts behaviors and attitudes, and directions for future work.",

    "Abstract": "In the era of digital communication, misinformation on social media threatens the foundational trust in these platforms. While myriad measures have been implemented to counteract misinformation, the complex relationship between these interventions and the multifaceted dynamics of trust and distrust on social media remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we surveyed 1,769 participants in the U.S. to gauge their trust and distrust in social media and examine their experiences with anti-misinformation features. Our research demonstrates how trust and distrust in social media are not simply two ends of a spectrum; but can also co-exist, enriching the theoretical understanding of these constructs. Furthermore, participants exhibited varying patterns of trust and distrust across demographic characteristics and platforms. Our results also show that current misinformation interventions helped heighten awareness of misinformation and bolstered trust in social media, but did not alleviate underlying distrust. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for future research.",

    "Abstract": "In avatar-mediated communications, users often cannot identify how others’ avatars are created, which is one of the important information they need to evaluate others. Thus, we tested a social virtual world that is transparent about others’ avatar-creation methods and investigated how knowing about others’ avatar-creation methods shapes users’ perceptions of others and their self-disclosure. We conducted a 2x2 mixed-design experiment with system design (nontransparent vs. transparent system) as a between-subjects and avatar-creation method (customized vs. personalized avatar) as a within-subjects variable with 60 participants. The results revealed that personalized avatars in the transparent system were viewed less positively than customized avatars in the transparent system or avatars in the nontransparent system. These avatars appeared less comfortable and honest in their self-disclosure and less competent. Interestingly, avatars in the nontransparent system attracted more followers. Our results suggest being cautious when creating a social virtual world that discloses the avatar-creation process.",

    "Abstract": "Adolescent peer relationships, essential for their development, are increasingly mediated by digital technologies. As this trend continues, wearable devices, especially smartwatches tailored for adolescents, is reshaping their socialization. In China, smartwatches like XTC have gained wide popularity, introducing unique features such as “Bump-to-Connect” and exclusive social platforms. Nonetheless, how these devices influence adolescents’ peer experience remains unknown. Addressing this, we interviewed 18 Chinese adolescents (age: 11—16), discovering a smartwatch-mediated social ecosystem. Our findings highlight the ice-breaking role of smartwatches in friendship initiation and their use for secret messaging with local peers. Within the online smartwatch community, peer status is determined by likes and visibility, leading to diverse pursuit activities (i.e., chu guanxi, jiazu, kuolie) and negative social dynamics. We discuss the core affordances of smartwatches and Chinese cultural factors that influence adolescent social behavior, and offer implications for designing future wearables that responsibly and safely support adolescent socialization.",

    "Abstract": "With the digitalization and mobilization of the society, older people face the challenge of maintaining high-quality communication with their younger family members who move out and lead separate lives at a distance. In HCI, little work is done to understand the social dynamics between distributed families and their remote communication mediated by the technologies. To identify design opportunities to support their remote communication, we conducted interviews with nine family pairs composed of distributed intergenerational family members. In addition, we interviewed eight community volunteers to formulate a perspective of social service providers. Our paper contributes to the HCI community by providing an account of the social dynamics mediated by communication technologies between older adults and their remote families, and opportunities to promote their social connections from a multi-stakeholder perspective. This paper presents valuable insights for designers aiming to enhance wellbeing of older adults within the context of distributed families.",

Towards this goal, we conducted focus groups with 20 teens to inform the design of a social media simulation platform and study for evaluating online safety nudges co-designed with teens. Participants evaluated risk scenarios, personas, platform features, and our research design to provide insight regarding the ecological validity of these artifacts. Teens expected risk scenarios to be subtle and tricky, while also higher in risk to be believable. The teens iterated on the nudges to prioritize risk prevention without reducing autonomy, risk coping, and community accountability. For the simulation, teens recommended using transparency with some deceit to balance realism and respect for participants. Our meta-level research provides a teen-centered action plan to evaluate online safety interventions safely and effectively.",

While HCI research has investigated people’s financial literacy and decision-making and how to design for it, little is known as to how people form financial conversations on social media. To answer this question, we used a grounded theory approach to analyzing financial conversations in the YOLO (‘you only live once’) posts on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (WSB), one of today’s largest financial online communities. We describe how WSB’s discursive culture portrays its gambling-like, high-risk trading by likening trading to gambling, celebrating it, and normalizing financial risk-taking. We discuss the rise of social investing, including how individual investors’ affective relationships encourage their outsized risk-taking, as well as reflect on its looming financial risks, especially to already marginalized groups. Lastly, we propose implications for design and policymaking.",

    "Abstract": "We conducted an ethnographically-informed study with 28 participants (9 autistic Young Adults or \"YAs\" in need of substantial daily support, 6 parents, 13 support staff) to understand how autistic YAs self-regulate and receive mediation on social media. We found that autistic YAs relied on blanket boundary rules and struggled with impulse control; therefore, they coped by asking their support network to help them deal with negative social experiences. Their support networks responded by providing informal advice, in-the-moment instruction, and formal education, but often resorted to monitoring and restrictive mediation when more proactive approaches were ineffective. Overall, we saw boundary tensions arise between Autistic YAs and their support networks as they struggled to find the right balance between providing oversight versus promoting autonomy. This work contributes to the critical disability literature by revealing the benefits and tensions of allyship in the context of helping young autistic adults navigate social media.",

Compounding this issue, the ageing population in China often encounters additional challenges in finding employment due to prevalent age discrimination in daily life. However, with the advent of social media, there has been a rise in the popularity of short videos and live-streams for recruiting ageing workers. To better understand the motivations of ageing job seekers to engage with these video-based recruitment methods and to explore the extent to which such platforms can empower them, we conducted an interview-based study with ageing job seekers who have had exposure to these short recruitment videos and live-streaming channels. Our findings reveal that these platforms can provide a job-seeking choice that is particularly friendly to ageing job seekers, effectively improving their disadvantaged situation.",

AI has further pervaded private conversations as conversational partners, auto-completion, and response suggestions. As social media becomes young people’s main method of peer support exchange, we need to understand when and how AI can facilitate and assist in such exchanges in a beneficial, safe, and socially appropriate way. We asked 622 young people to complete an online survey and evaluate blinded human- and AI-generated responses to help-seeking messages. We found that participants preferred the AI-generated response to situations about relationships, self-expression, and physical health. However, when addressing a sensitive topic, like suicidal thoughts, young people preferred the human response. We also discuss the role of training in online peer support exchange and its implications for supporting young people’s well-being.

But we know little about the impact of recent changes to laws governing sex education and the right to abortion on teen reproductive health information seeking and sharing. We conducted interviews with 15 teens, finding that, post-Roe, teens are concerned about risks to their reproductive health data, particularly as it relates to what they search and share on social media and period tracking apps. Different assessments of risk related to sexual activity, state laws, social context, and cultural and family values dictate information practices. But social risk (like being harassed or doxxed) is the biggest driver of information seeking and sharing practices among mostly non-sexually active teens. We describe the complexities of teens navigating reproductive health post-Roe and offer some guidance about teen technology and privacy literacy.",

To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with 17 queer women, aiming to uncover their experiences and challenges in online dating within the conservative context of South Korea. Contrary to their initial expectations of exploring open-ended forms of interaction, we found that dating applications tended to systematically normalize queerness in sexuality presentation, relationship building, and shared identities in the community. These mechanisms forced them to conform to the “normalized queerness,” thereby impeding non-normative and flexible aspects of queer interactions. Building upon these findings, we discuss how the technological affordances of online dating platforms facilitate the normalization of queerness under the influence of sociocultural contexts of South Korea.",

    "Abstract": "Since the inception of social media, parents have been sharing information about their children online. Unfortunately, this “sharenting” can expose children to several online and offline risks. Although researchers have studied sharenting on multiple platforms, sharenting on short-form video platforms like TikTok—where posts can contain detailed information, spread quickly, and spark considerable engagement—is understudied. Thus, we provide a targeted exploration of sharenting on TikTok. We analyzed 328 TikTok videos that demonstrate sharenting and 438 videos where TikTok creators discuss sharenting norms. Our results indicate that sharenting on TikTok indeed creates several risks for children, not only within individual posts but also in broader patterns of sharenting that arise when parents repeatedly use children to generate viral content. At the same time, creators voiced sharenting concerns and boundaries that reflect what has been observed on other platforms, indicating the presence of cross-platform norms. Promisingly, we observed that TikTok users are engaging in thoughtful conversations around sharenting and beginning to shift norms toward safer sharenting. We offer concrete suggestions for designers and platforms based on our findings.",

Previous research has attempted to address this issue by increasing the diversity of information exposure, which is often hindered by a lack of user motivation to engage with. In this study, we took a human-centered approach to explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) could assist users in embracing more diverse perspectives. We developed a prototype featuring LLM-powered multi-agent characters that users could interact with while reading social media content. We conducted a participatory design study with 18 participants and found that multi-agent dialogues with gamification incentives could motivate users to engage with opposing viewpoints. Additionally, progressive interactions with assessment tasks could promote thoughtful consideration. Based on these findings, we provided design implications with future work outlooks for leveraging LLMs to help users burst their filter bubbles.",

    "Abstract": "Short videos on social media are the dominant way young people consume content. News outlets aim to reach audiences through news reels—short videos conveying news—but struggle to translate traditional journalistic formats into short, entertaining videos. To translate news into social media reels, we support journalists in reframing the narrative. In literature, narrative framing is a high-level structure that shapes the overall presentation of a story. We identified three narrative framings for reels that adapt social media norms but preserve news value, each with a different balance of information and entertainment. We introduce ReelFramer, a human-AI co-creative system that helps journalists translate print articles into scripts and storyboards. ReelFramer supports exploring multiple narrative framings to find one appropriate to the story. AI suggests foundational narrative details, including characters, plot, setting, and key information. ReelFramer also supports visual framing; AI suggests character and visual detail designs before generating a full storyboard. Our studies show that narrative framing introduces the necessary diversity to translate various articles into reels, and establishing foundational details helps generate scripts that are more relevant and coherent. We also discuss the benefits of using narrative framing and foundational details in content retargeting.",

    "Abstract": "Stratifying depressed individuals may help to improve recovery rates by identifying the subgroups who would benefit from targeted treatments. Detecting depressed individuals with prominent anhedonia (i.e. lack of pleasure) may be one effective approach, given these individuals experience poorer treatment outcomes. This paper explores the linguistic features associated with anhedonia among depressed adults. Over 9 weeks, 218 individuals with depressive symptoms completed a fortnightly psychometric measure of depression (PHQ-9) and provided text data (SMS, social media posts, expressive essays, emotion diaries, personal letters). Linguistic features were examined using LIWC-22. Greater use of discrepancy words was significantly associated with higher anhedonia, but in SMS data only. Machine learning showed some utility for predicting increased anhedonia, with discrepancy words the most important linguistic feature in the model. Discrepancy words were not found to be associated with overall depression scores. These results suggest that this linguistic feature may show some promise for the stratification of anhedonic depression.",

    "Name": "Persuasion or Insulting? Unpacking Discursive Strategies of Gender Debate in Everyday Feminism in China",
    "Abstract": "Speaking out for women’s daily needs on social media has become a crucial form of everyday feminism in China. Gender debate naturally intertwines with such feminist advocacy, where users in opposite stances discuss gender-related issues through intense discourse. The complexities of gender debate necessitate a systematic understanding of discursive strategies for achieving effective gender communication that balances civility and constructiveness. To address this problem, we adopted a mixed-methods study to navigate discursive strategies in gender debate, focusing on 38,636 posts and 187,539 comments from two representative cases in China. Through open coding, we identified a comprehensive taxonomy of linguistic strategies in gender debate, capturing five overarching themes including derogation, gender distinction, intensification, mitigation, and cognizance guidance. Further, we applied regression analysis to unveil these strategies’ correlations with user participation and response, illustrating the tension between debating tactics and public engagement. We discuss design implications to facilitate feminist advocacy on social media. Content Warning: This paper contains discussions on gender debate that may include swear words and sensitive topics, such as sex, potentially causing discomfort.",

    "Abstract": "Early detection and intervention for relapse is important in the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Researchers have developed AI models to predict relapse from patient-contributed data like social media. However, these models face challenges, including misalignment with practice and ethical issues related to transparency, accountability, and potential harm. Furthermore, how patients who have recovered from schizophrenia view these AI models has been underexplored. To address this gap, we first conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 patients and reflexive thematic analysis, which revealed a disconnect between AI predictions and patient experience, and the importance of the social aspect of relapse detection. In response, we developed a prototype that used patients’ Facebook data to predict relapse. Feedback from seven patients highlighted the potential for AI to foster collaboration between patients and their support systems, and to encourage self-reflection. Our work provides insights into human-AI interaction and suggests ways to empower people with schizophrenia.",

    "Abstract": "Online platforms employ manual human moderation to distinguish human-created social media profiles from deepfake-generated ones. Biased misclassification of real profiles as artificial can harm general users as well as specific identity groups; however, no work has yet systematically investigated such mistakes and biases. We conducted a user study (n=695) that investigates how 1) the identity of the profile, 2) whether the moderator shares that identity, and 3) components of a profile shown affect the perceived artificiality of the profile. We find statistically significant biases in people’s moderation of LinkedIn profiles based on all three factors. Further, upon examining how moderators make decisions, we find they rely on mental models of AI and attackers, as well as typicality expectations (how they think the world works). The latter includes reliance on race/gender stereotypes. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for the design of moderation interfaces, moderation teams, and security training.",

    "Abstract": "Designing user experiences for group recommendation systems (GRS) is challenging, requiring a nuanced understanding of the influence of social interactions between users. Using Spotify Blend as a real-world case of music GRS, we conducted empirical studies to investigate intricate social interactions among South Korean users in GRS. Through a preliminary survey about Blend experiences in general, we narrowed the focus for the main study to relationships between two users who are acquainted or close. Building on this, we conducted a 21-day diary study and interviews with 30 participants (15 pairs) to probe more in-depth interpersonal dynamics within Blend. Our findings reveal that users engaged in implicit social interactions, including tacit understanding of their companions and indirect communication. We conclude by discussing the newly discovered value of GRS as a social catalyst, along with design attributes and challenges for the social experiences it mediates.",

While the West has started to examine the limitations and risks associated with these tools, their impacts on the Global South have remained understudied. Based on our interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and social media-based qualitative study, this paper reports how popular text-to-image GAI tools (ex., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Firefly) are affecting various image-related local creative fields. We report how these tools limit the creative explorations of marginal artists, struggle to understand linguistic nuances, fail to generate local forms of art and architecture, and misrepresent the diversity among citizens in the image production process. Drawing from a rich body of work on critical image theory, postcolonial computing, and design politics, we explain how our findings are pertinent to HCI’s broader interest in social justice, decolonization, and global development.",

    "Abstract": "Recent increases in self-harm and suicide rates among youth have coincided with prevalent social media use; therefore, making these sensitive topics of critical importance to the HCI research community. We analyzed 1,224 direct message conversations (DMs) from 151 young Instagram users (ages 13-21), who engaged in private conversations using self-harm and suicide-related language. We found that youth discussed their personal experiences, including imminent thoughts of suicide and/or self-harm, as well as their past attempts and recovery. They gossiped about others, including complaining about triggering content and coercive threats of self-harm and suicide but also tried to intervene when a friend was in danger. Most of the conversations involved suicide or self-harm language that did not indicate the intent to harm but instead used hyperbolical language or humor. Our results shed light on youth perceptions, norms, and experiences of self-harm and suicide to inform future efforts towards risk detection and prevention. Content Warning: This paper discusses the sensitive topics of self-harm and suicide. Reader discretion is advised.",

    "Abstract": "The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has consistently focused on the experiences of users moderated by social media platforms. Recently, scholars have noticed that moderation practices could perpetuate biases, resulting in the marginalization of user groups undergoing moderation. However, most studies have primarily addressed marginalization related to issues such as racism or sexism, with little attention given to the experiences of people with disabilities. In this paper, we present a study on the moderation experiences of blind users on TikTok, also known as \"BlindToker,\" to address this gap. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 BlindTokers and used thematic analysis to analyze the data. Two main themes emerged: BlindTokers’ situated content moderation experiences and their reactions to content moderation. We reported on the lack of accessibility on TikTok’s platform, contributing to the moderation and marginalization of BlindTokers. Additionally, we discovered instances of harassment from trolls that prompted BlindTokers to respond with harsh language, triggering further moderation. We discussed these findings in the context of the literature on moderation, marginalization, and transformative justice, seeking solutions to address such issues.",

    "Abstract": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often seek comfort from devices (e.g., smartphones) to deal with social overstimulation. However, such reliance exposes them to inappropriate digital content and increases susceptibility to mimicry and social vulnerability. Thus, parents having children with ASD encounter unique challenges in regulating their device usage, which are little addressed in the existing literature on parental mediation. As we begin to address this gap, we designed low-fidelity prototypes centered around open communication and self-regulation, which we refined based on the feedback from six ASD experts in two focus groups. We evaluated updated designs (presented in form of storyboards) through semi-structured interviews with 25 parents whose children with ASD (aged below 14) are active Internet users. Our study joins the body of work on parental mediation; our findings provide insights into inclusive parental control tools for children with ASD, and offer guidelines for future research in these directions.",

This paper investigates digital repression by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority through semi-structured interviews – in-person and online – with 19 Palestinian activists who post on social media. Many of our findings echo those from other repressive contexts, but the unusual Palestinian context also gives rise to several unique elements. For example, Palestinian authorities, while incorporating some high-tech methods, appear to rely primarily on a low-tech, labor-intensive apparatus to monitor, intimidate, and censor their targets, some of which involves highly personalized forms of repression. We also heard credible accusations of Palestinian authorities’ collaboration with Iranian and Israeli governments, the latter typically viewed as an adversary by Palestinians. We consider the implications of these findings and offer recommendations both for activists and social media platforms.",

Although AI has been proposed to help scale up counterspeech efforts, this raises questions of how exactly AI could assist in this process, since counterspeech is a deeply empathetic and agentic process for those involved. In this work, we aim to answer this question, by conducting in-depth interviews with 10 extensively experienced counterspeakers and a large scale public survey with 342 everyday social media users. In participant responses, we identified four main types of barriers and AI needs related to resources, training, impact, and personal harms. However, our results also revealed overarching concerns of authenticity, agency, and functionality in using AI tools for counterspeech. To conclude, we discuss considerations for designing AI assistants that lower counterspeaking barriers without jeopardizing its meaning and purpose.",

    "Abstract": "People with disabilities experience high levels of social discrimination worldwide. But, these harms are more pronounced in the Global South due to the intense stigma around disability and its intersections with structural embeddings of patriarchy. The massive growth of social media in the Global South provides people with disabilities a unique opportunity to advocate for disability rights and challenge regressive ableist norms. Yet, little is known about the challenges they face in doing their advocacy work on social media. Through interviews with 20 disability advocates in India with diverse gender identities and abilities, we found that disability advocates routinely face ableist hate and harassment, patronizing and invalidating comments, and lack of visibility and support, which forces them to self-censor as a form of self-protection, leading to low advocacy outcomes. We draw on these findings to illuminate the role of social media in the invisibilization of people with disabilities in the online sphere.",

Much of modern political communication occurs on social media, which may exacerbate these challenges. This study examines how the design of social media features impact political communication. We examined how the introduction of Facebook Reactions influenced the posts of the 114th US Congress on the platform. We start by analyzing the emotional content of posts, finding that politicians generally increased their usage of negative emotions in their posts after the feature’s launch. Further analysis showed that increased user engagement preceded the rise in negative emotions, suggesting that politicians were making adjustments based on user feedback. Our results show that the design features of social media can shape online political communication.",

We conducted a walkthrough of the BeReal app and interviewed 31 young adults about their experiences on BeReal. We found that participants approached authenticity in two ways—as extemporaneous interaction and as comprehensive self-presentation—and that BeReal harnesses the affordances of visibility, editability, availability, and persistence in a way that enables the former more than the latter.

We collected usage data from N = 1, 039 users of one sec over an average of 13.4 weeks and qualitative insights from 249 of the users through an online survey. We found that users overwhelmingly choose to target Social Media apps. We found that the short design frictions introduced by one sec effectively reduce how often users attempt to open target apps and lead to more intentional app-openings over time. Additionally, we found that users take periodic breaks from one sec interventions, and quickly rebound from a pattern of overuse when returning from breaks. Overall, we contribute findings from a longitudinal investigation of design frictions in the wild and identify usage patterns from real users in practice.",

This approach can be amplified using targeted clickbait that takes publicly available information from social media to align clickbait to users’ preferences and beliefs. In this work, we first conducted preliminary studies to understand the influence of targeted clickbait on users’ clicking behavior. Based on our findings, we involved 24 users in the participatory design of story-based warnings against targeted clickbait. Our analysis of user-created warnings led to four design variations, which we evaluated through an online survey over Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our findings show the significance of integrating information with persuasive narratives to create effective warnings against targeted clickbait. Overall, our studies provide valuable insights into understanding users’ perceptions and behaviors towards targeted clickbait, and the efficacy of story-based interventions.",

However, the academic understanding of Instagram’s poetry community is limited, yet its significance emerges from its distinctive utilization of a primarily visual social media platform guided by recommendation algorithms for disseminating poetry, further characterized by a predominantly novice creative population. We employ qualitative analysis to explore motivations, experiences, and algorithmic influence within Instagram’s poetry community. We demonstrate that participants prioritize conforming to algorithmic constraints for visibility, yet maintain their community’s values of integrity and originality, illustrating the tension between algorithmic growth and participant authenticity. We introduce the concept of Algorithmically Mediated Creative Labor, a phenomenon specific to non-monetizing creative users who are impacted by the prioritization of professional creators and continually adapt their creative endeavours to align with platform logic, thereby affecting their motivation and creative outputs.",

Prior work has studied how data visualizations can mislead, but do misleading visualizations reach a broad social media audience? And if so, do users amplify or challenge misleading interpretations? To answer these questions, we conducted a mixed-methods analysis of the public’s engagement with data visualization posts about COVID-19 on Twitter. Compared to posts with accurate visual insights, our results show that posts with misleading visualizations garner more replies in which the audiences point out nuanced fallacies and caveats in data interpretations.

Through surveys (N=50) and interviews (N=20) with disabled creators, we developed a taxonomy of 11 types of ableist hate and harassment (e.g., eugenics-related speech, denial and stigmatization of accessibility) and outlined how ableism harms creators’ well-being and content creation practices. Using statistical modeling, we investigated differences in ableist experiences given creators’ intersecting identities such as race and sexuality. We found that LGBTQ disabled creators face significantly more ableist hate compared to non-LGBTQ disabled creators. Lastly, we discuss our findings through an infrastructure lens to highlight how disabled creators experience platform-enabled ableism, undergo labor to cope with hate, and develop strategies to safeguard against future hate.",

    "Abstract": "Conversational Agents (CAs) have increasingly been integrated into everyday life, sparking significant discussions on social media. While previous research has examined public perceptions of AI in general, there is a notable lack in research focused on CAs, with fewer investigations into cultural variations in CA perceptions. To address this gap, this study used computational methods to analyze about one million social media discussions surrounding CAs and compared people’s discourses and perceptions of CAs in the US and China. We find Chinese participants tended to view CAs hedonically, perceived voice-based and physically embodied CAs as warmer and more competent, and generally expressed positive emotions. In contrat, US participants saw CAs more functionally, with an ambivalent attitude. Warm perception was a key driver of positive emotions toward CAs in both countries. We discussed practical implications for designing contextually sensitive and user-centric CAs to resonate with various users’ preferences and needs.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the tensions between neighborhood gentrification and community surveillance posts on Nextdoor, a hyperlocal social media platform for neighborhoods. We created a privacy-preserving pipeline to gather research data from public Nextdoor posts in Atlanta, Georgia and filtered these to a dataset of 1,537 community surveillance posts. We developed a qualitative codebook to label observed patterns of community surveillance, and deploy a large language model to tag these posts at scale. Ultimately, we present an extensible and empirically-tested typology of the modes of community surveillance that occur on hyperlocal platforms. We find a complex relationship between community surveillance posts and neighborhood gentrification, which indicates that publicly disclosing information about perceived outsiders, especially for petty crimes, is most prevalent in gentrifying neighborhoods. Our empirical evidence inform critical perspectives which posit that community surveillance on platforms like Nextdoor can exclude and marginalize minoritized populations, particularly in gentrifying neighborhoods. Our findings carry broader implications for hyperlocal social platforms and their potential to amplify and exacerbate social tensions and exclusion.",

    "Abstract": "In a world where digital technology is omnipresent, North Korea stands as an outlier, with most citizens uninformed about its existence. This study explores the experiences of North Korean defectors as they transition to a highly digitally connected society—South Korea. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we initially investigate the critical needs and challenges they encounter during their transitions. Then, we examine the role of digital technology as they adapt to the highly connected digital environment of South Korea. Our findings highlight that social media serves as a double-edged sword, providing the freedom to construct a desired identity while accentuating the gap between their real and ideal selves. This empirical research offers insights into how an underrepresented population navigates the digital landscape during life transitions, shedding light on the drawbacks and ways to better address their needs.",

    "Abstract": "Emergency response to large-scale disasters is often supported with multimedia from social media. However, while these features are common in everyday video calls, the complex needs of 911 and other systems make it difficult to directly incorporate these features. We assess an ME911 (Multimedia-Enabled 911) app to understand how the design will need to deviate from common norms and how callers will respond to those non-standard choices. We expand the role of 911 call taker control over emergency situations to the calling interface while incorporating key features like map-based location finding. Participants’ experiences in mock emergencies show the non-standard design helps callers in the unfamiliar setting of emergency calling yet it also causes confusion and delays. We find the need for emergency-specific deviations from design norms is supported by participant feedback. We discuss how broader system changes will support callers to use these non-standard designs during emergencies.",

    "Abstract": "Social media feeds are deeply personal spaces that reflect individual values and preferences. However, top-down, platform-wide content algorithms can reduce users’ sense of agency and fail to account for nuanced experiences and values. Drawing on the paradigm of interactive machine teaching (IMT), an interaction framework for non-expert algorithmic adaptation, we map out a design space for teachable social media feed experiences to empower agential, personalized feed curation. To do so, we conducted a think-aloud study (N = 24) featuring four social media platforms—Instagram, Mastodon, TikTok, and Twitter—to understand key signals users leveraged to determine the value of a post in their feed. We synthesized users’ signals into taxonomies that, when combined with user interviews, inform five design principles that extend IMT into the social media setting. We finally embodied our principles into three feed designs that we present as sensitizing concepts for teachable feed experiences moving forward.",

    "Abstract": "Drawing upon theories from communication studies and cognitive psychology, this research develops a multitheoretical model that identifies human and technological factors that predict social media distraction engagement and explains how social media distractions can lead to negative consequences across various tasks. This model is empirically tested using data from a survey of U.S. mobile phone users (N = 1,026). The results from a structural equation modeling analysis support the model’s predictions that a person’s age, fear of missing out, smartphone checking habit strength, and the number of social media applications with notifications enabled all impact a variety of distraction behaviors and consequences. The findings show that communication technology distraction behavior is influenced by a complex intertwining of goal-driven communication and information-seeking behaviors, automatic processes in the brain, and technology affordances.",

    "Abstract": "Data analysts have long sought to turn unstructured text data into meaningful concepts. Though common, topic modeling and clustering focus on lower-level keywords and require significant interpretative work. We introduce concept induction, a computational process that instead produces high-level concepts, defined by explicit inclusion criteria, from unstructured text. For a dataset of toxic online comments, where a state-of-the-art BERTopic model outputs “women, power, female,” concept induction produces high-level concepts such as “Criticism of traditional gender roles” and “Dismissal of women’s concerns.” We present LLooM, a concept induction algorithm that leverages large language models to iteratively synthesize sampled text and propose human-interpretable concepts of increasing generality. We then instantiate LLooM in a mixed-initiative text analysis tool, enabling analysts to shift their attention from interpreting topics to engaging in theory-driven analysis. Through technical evaluations and four analysis scenarios ranging from literature review to content moderation, we find that LLooM’s concepts improve upon the prior art of topic models in terms of quality and data coverage. In expert case studies, LLooM helped researchers to uncover new insights even from familiar datasets, for example by suggesting a previously unnoticed concept of attacks on out-party stances in a political social media dataset.",

While disability advocacy groups globally have secured hard-won accessibility regulations for broadcast media, no such regulation of user-generated content exists. Yet, one major player in this shift, TikTok, has a culture of user-generated, creative captioning. We sought to understand how TikTok videos are captioned and the impact current practices have on those who need captions to access audio content. Therefore, we conducted a content analysis of 300 open-captioned TikToks and contextualized these findings by interviewing nine caption users. We found that the current state of TikTok captioning does facilitate access to the platform but that a user-generated, social video-specific standard for captioning could improve caption quality and expand access. We contribute an empirical account of the state of TikTok captioning and outline steps toward a standard for user-generated captioning.",

The toolkit responds to the call to maintain the locality of data by promoting a qualitative and contextualized approach to analyzing Twitter data. We assessed the toolkit’s effectiveness in guiding practitioners to search, collect, and be critical when analyzing data from Twitter. We evaluated the toolkit with ten practitioners from three non-profit organizations of different aims and sizes in Mexico. The assessment surfaced tensions between the assumptions embedded in the toolkit’s design and practitioners’ expectations, needs, and backgrounds. We show that practitioners navigated these tensions in some cases by developing strategies and, in others, questioning the appropriateness of using Twitter data to inform their work. We conclude with recommendations for researchers who developed tools for non-profit organizations to inform humanitarian action.",

    "Abstract": "Online polarisation can tear the fabric of civility through reinforcing social media’s perceptions of division and discord. Social media platforms often rely on content-moderation to combat polarisation, contingent on the reactive removal or flagging of content. However, this approach often remains agnostic of the underlying debate’s ideas and stifles open discourse. In this study, we use prompt-tuned language models to mediate social media debates, applying the strategies of the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI). We evaluate multiple mediation strategies in providing targeted responses to the debates, as shown to a debate audience. Our findings show that high-cooperativeness TKI strategies offered more persuasive arguments, while an accommodating argument strategy was the most successful at depolarising the audience’s opinion. Furthermore, high-cooperativeness strategies also increased the perception that the debaters will reach a consensus. Our work paves the way for scalable and personalised tools that mediate social media debates to encourage depolarisation.",

Whilst attention being given to menopause in HCI may be new, people experiencing it is not and people have adopted, adapted and appropriated technologies to support their menopause journey. In this questionnaire and interview study, we examine how people in the UK are using (and not using) existing general and menopause-specific technology to support themselves through the transition. Despite limited menopause-specific technologies available, participants have found novel uses of technologies such as social media and smartwatches for 1) connecting and sharing, 2) information seeking, 3) tracking and reflecting, and 4) self-care. This work contributes design considerations for menopause specific technologies, and design opportunities and challenges for technologies that can be appropriated to support menopause.",

While strides have been made regarding the computational facets of algorithms for “real-time” risk detection, such research has not yet evaluated these advancements through a human-centered lens. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 53 peer-reviewed articles on real-time risk detection on social media. Real-time detection was mainly operationalized as “early” detection after-the-fact based on pre-defined chunks of data and evaluated based on standard performance metrics, such as timeliness. We identified several human-centered opportunities for advancing current algorithms, such as integrating human insight in feature selection, algorithms’ improvement considering human behavior, and utilizing human evaluations. This work serves as a critical call-to-action for the HCI and ML communities to work together to protect social media users before, during, and after exposure to risks.",

Notable is the “observer effect,” where awareness of being monitored can alter people’s social media use. We present a causal-inference study to examine this phenomenon on the longitudinal Facebook use of 300+ participants who voluntarily shared their data spanning an average of 82 months before and 5 months after study enrollment. We measured deviation from participants’ expected social media use through time series analyses. Individuals with high cognitive ability and low neuroticism decreased posting immediately after enrollment, and those with high openness increased posting. The sharing of self-focused content decreased, while diverse topics emerged. We situate the findings within theories of self-presentation and self-consciousness. We discuss the implications of correcting observer effect in social media data-driven measurements, and how this phenomenon shines light on the ethics of these measurements.",

Such content is often described as “for you,” raising questions about the relationship between users’ sense of “self” and the “you” that is represented. Answering such questions is pressing in the case of teen users whose identities are still forming. Thus we ask, “What do teens think about the relationship between personalized content and their sense of self?” We interviewed teens aged 13 to 17 (n = 15) about their experiences with personalized content on social media. Participants so routinely saw themselves accurately reflected in personalized content that they noted the occasional inaccuracy with surprise, while simply scrolling past it. Our findings point to: the normalization of data doubles in the form of personalized content; and teens’ indifference to inaccuracies presented by such data doubles.",

    "Abstract": "We collected and analyzed Instagram direct messages (DMs) from 173 youth aged 13–21 (including 86 LGBTQ+ youth). We examined youth’s risk-flagged social media trace data with their self-reported mental health outcomes to examine how the differing online experiences of LGBTQ+ youth compare with their heterosexual counterparts. We found that LGBTQ+ youth experienced significantly more high-risk online interactions compared to heterosexual youth. LGBTQ+ youth reported overall poorer mental health, with online harassment specifically amplifying Self-Harm and Injury. LGBTQ+ youth’s mental well-being linked positively to sexual messages, unlike heterosexual youth. Qualitatively, we found that most of the risk-flagged messages of LGBTQ+ youth were sexually motivated; however, a silver lining was that they sought support for their sexual identity from peers on the platform. The study highlights the importance of tailored online safety and inclusive design for LGBTQ+ youth, with implications for CHI community advancements in fostering a supportive online environments.Content Warning: This research discusses sensitive topics, including explicit sexual content, abusive language, and homophobic slurs, which may cause discomfort.

While much attention has been given to children’s online well-being, a pressing concern often goes unnoticed: the pervasive data harvesting underlying social media and its manipulative impact on undermining children’s autonomy. In this paper, we present CHAITok, an Android mobile application designed to enhance children’s sense of autonomy over their data on social media. Through 27 user study sessions with 109 children aged 10–13, we offer insights into the current lack of data autonomy among children regarding their online information, and how we can foster children’s sense of data autonomy through a socio-technical journey. Our findings inspire design recommendations to respect children’s values, support children’s evolving autonomy, and design for children’s digital rights. We emphasize data autonomy as a fundamental right for children, call for further research, design innovation, and policy changes on this critical issue.",

    "Name": "Analyzing Security and Privacy Advice During the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine on Twitter",
    "Abstract": "The Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 resulted in a rapidly changing cyber threat environment globally and incentivized the sharing of security and privacy advice on social media. Previous research found a strong impact of online security advice on end-user behavior. Twitter is an important platform for sharing information in crises. We examined 306&nbsp;tweets with security and privacy advice related to the Ukrainian war, and created a taxonomy of 224&nbsp;unique pieces of advice in seven categories, targeted at individuals or organizations in Ukraine and elsewhere. While our findings include untargeted and generic advice known from previous research, we identify novel advice specific to the invasion, offers for individual consultation, and misinformation on security and privacy advice as a new threat. Our findings highlight the strengths and shortcomings of the security and privacy advice given online during the invasion and establish areas for improvements and future research.",

    "Abstract": "To use social media is to interact with digital representations of oneself in the form of algorithmically-determined personalized content. Yet when we assume that interactions with personalized content will be a persistent feature of our futures, the concepts available to frame such digital representations&nbsp;–&nbsp;things variously called doubles, twins, and doppelgangers&nbsp;–&nbsp;appear as worryingly creepy. Where might one find optimism amid such presumptive creepiness? Through conceptual analysis of data doubles, digital twins, and data doppelgangers, we identify and explain one source of justifiable optimism. Unlike the double and twin, the data doppelganger’s dynamics center difference rather than presumed sameness. Fostering justifiable optimism about the futures of personalization&nbsp;–&nbsp;with social media as a starting point&nbsp;–&nbsp;requires learning how to design for the experience of difference represented by the doppelganger: the irreducibility of the person to the represented user.",

    "Abstract": "Social media platform design often incorporates explicit signals of positive feedback. Some moderators provide positive feedback with the goal of positive reinforcement, but are often unsure of their ability to actually influence user behavior. Despite its widespread use and theory touting positive feedback as crucial for user motivation, its effect on recipients is relatively unknown. This paper examines how positive feedback impacts Reddit users and evaluates its differential effects to understand who benefits most from receiving positive feedback. Through a causal inference study of 11M posts across 4 months, we find that users who received positive feedback made more frequent (2% per day) and higher quality (57% higher score; 2% fewer removals per day) posts compared to a set of matched control users. Our findings highlight the need for platforms, communities, and moderators to expand their perspective on moderation and complement punitive approaches with positive reinforcement strategies to foster desirable behavior online.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid spread of harmful misinformation has led to a dire need for effective media literacy interventions, to which educational games have been suggested as a possible solution. Researchers and educators have created several games that increase media literacy and resilience to misinformation. However, the existing body of misinformation education games rarely focus upon the socio-emotional influences that factor into misinformation belief. Misinformation correction and serious games have both explored narrative as a method to engage with people on an emotional basis. To this end, we investigated how 123 young adults (mean age = 22.98) experienced narrative transportation and identification in two narrative-centered misinformation escape room games developed for library settings. We found that propensity for certain misinformation contexts, such as engagement with fan culture and likelihood to share on social media platforms, significantly affected how participants experienced specific measures of narrative immersion within the games. We discuss design implications for tailoring educational interventions to specific misinformation contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Existing tools for laypeople to create personal classifiers often assume a motivated user working uninterrupted in a single, lengthy session. However, users tend to engage with social media casually, with many short sessions on an ongoing, daily basis. To make creating personal classifiers for content curation easier for such users, tools should support rapid initialization and iterative refinement. In this work, we compare three strategies—(1) example labeling, (2) rule writing, and (3) large language model (LLM) prompting—for end users to build personal content classifiers. From an experiment with 37 non-programmers tasked with creating personalized moderation filters, we found that participants preferred different initializing strategies in different contexts, despite LLM prompting’s better performance. However, all strategies faced challenges with iterative refinement. To overcome challenges in iterating on their prompts, participants even adopted hybrid approaches such as providing examples as in-context examples or writing rule-like prompts.",

    "Abstract": "A highlight is a short edit of the original video that includes the most engaging moments. Given the rigid timing of TV commercial slots and length limits of social media uploads, generating highlights of specific lengths is crucial. Previous research on automatic highlight generation often overlooked the control over the duration of the final video, producing highlights of arbitrary lengths. We propose a novel system that automatically generates highlights of any user-specified length. Our system leverages Most Replayed Data (MRD), which identifies how frequently a video has been watched over time, to gauge the most engaging parts. It then optimizes the final editing path by adjusting internal segment durations. We evaluated the quality of our system’s outputs through two user studies, including a comparison with highlights created by human editors. Results show that our system can automatically produce highlights that are indistinguishable from those created by humans in viewing experience.",

However, they also present significant obstacles for content creators trying to predict and manage their audience reach. This issue is particularly challenging for marginalized groups seeking to maintain safe spaces. Our study explores how women on Xiaohongshu (rednote), a recommendation-driven social platform, proactively re-appropriate hashtags (e.g., #宝宝辅食, Baby Supplemental Food) by using them in posts unrelated to their literal meaning. The hashtags were strategically chosen from topics that would be uninteresting to the male audience they wanted to block. Through a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed the practice of hashtag re-appropriation based on 5,800 collected posts and interviewed 24 active users from diverse backgrounds to uncover users’ motivations and reactions towards the re-appropriation. This practice highlights how users can reclaim agency over content distribution on recommendation-driven platforms, offering insights into self-governance within algorithmic-centered power structures.",

    "Abstract": "Misinformation has been studied with various social media user groups, though not with Deaf and Hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals. To address this gap, we conducted an interview with 15 DHH participants to explore their lived experiences with misinformation and their perspectives on common moderation and debunking approaches on social media. We found that participants often experience falsehoods, and highlighted examples specific to the DHH community such as misinformation related to American Sign Language (ASL) and Deaf culture. However, moderation interventions and debunking strategies for misinformation specific to DHH topics were lacking. Written warnings may be beneficial as long as they use language appropriate for DHH people with diverse literacy skills. Participants found visual interventions (e.g., videos) more beneficial as long as they can be appropriately captioned – which is not always the case in practice. Our findings provide practical moderation insights for DHH social media users.",

Prior work has shown that platform moderation often fails to remove ableist hate, leaving disabled users exposed to harmful content. This paper examines how personalized moderation can safeguard users from viewing ableist comments. During interviews and focus groups with 23 disabled social media users, we presented design probes to elicit perceptions on configuring their filters of ableist speech (e.g., intensity of ableism and types of ableism) and customizing the presentation of the ableist speech to mitigate the harm (e.g., AI rephrasing the comment and content warnings). We found that participants preferred configuring their filters through types of ableist speech and favored content warnings. We surface participants’ distrust in AI-based moderation, skepticism in AI’s accuracy, and varied tolerances in viewing ableist hate. Finally, we share design recommendations to support users’ agency, mitigate harm from hate, and promote safety.",

However, the deployment of machine learning models, e.g., when, where, and how they are used, in social media applications is opaque to users. We aim to address this inconsistency and investigate how social media user perceptions and behaviors change once exposed to these models. We conducted user studies (N=21) and found that participants were unaware to both what the models output and when the models were used in Instagram and TikTok, two major social media platforms. In response to being exposed to the models' functionality, we observed long term behavior changes in 8 participants. Our analysis uncovers the challenges and opportunities in providing transparency for machine learning models that interact with local user data.",

In this paper, we examine the role of technology in moments of crisis and the tensions mutual aid groups face when relying on tools designed with values that may be antithetical to their own. Through a qualitative study with mutual aid volunteers in the United States, we found that mutual aid groups’ values, such as solidarity, security, and co-production, are prioritized as they navigate adopting technology. However, while technology can streamline logistics and enhance visibility for mutual aid groups, we argue that the adoption of existing technologies and conventions of practice can erode opportunities for building solidarity, present challenges for accountability, and exacerbate pre-existing social exclusions. We argue that these tensions emerge not simply as a mismatch between values and technical design, but as systematic outcomes of adopting tools that embed different political assumptions and points of access. Our findings contribute to understanding how values shape — and are shaped by — technological infrastructure in mutual aid work.",

Through 18 interviews, our study examined how information and identity work on social media influences health behaviors, social interactions, self-expression, and navigation of algorithms for those with food allergies. Social media functions as both a source of empowerment and community and a platform for stigma and emotional distress. Our findings highlight how individuals manage their food allergy identity and online visibility on algorithm-driven platforms. The concept of “on-and-off identities” is introduced to capture this complex identity work. Design considerations for HCI include: 1) creating mindful social media experiences that support agency while addressing vulnerability in identity and information work, and 2) reflections on the challenges of evolving health contexts and social media ecologies. We urge HCI researchers and designers to adopt a holistic perspective on identity and information work to better support marginalized populations.",

    "Abstract": "In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms—e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1) Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2) Trust in the labels and 3) Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s belief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by defining a design space for label implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of labels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.",

    "Abstract": "Control and curation of dominant visual culture – rendering who and what is visible – is central to identity formation, particularly for LGBTQ+ communities relying on digital spaces for safe self-expression. In this work, we analyze Instagram as a site of algorithmic visual curation, performing a quantitative analysis of algorithmically mediated image feeds delivered to a gay-coded user. Our persona account exclusively followed #gay and #instagay feeds, and engaged in content within these discursive spaces to seed algorithmic content promotion to a normative gay user. We present an analysis of skin tone presentations, emoji usage, and engagement metrics alongside analysis of generative outputs of dominant visual trends within the #gay search and Explore feeds. We observe content depicting darker-skinned individuals has higher engagement yet less algorithmic promotion relative to lighter skin tones, while hypermasculine and homonormative content is heavily promoted. These results suggest that, while marginalized positionalities have certainly been rendered more visible through social media platforms, this visibility is increasingly contingent on assimilation to normative ideals through algorithmically determined modes that are not necessarily consistent with user choices, preferences, or realities.",

This may lead to incorrect self-medication and place additional burdens on healthcare providers to correct patients’ misconceptions. In this work, we conducted two mixed-method studies to identify design goals for mitigating availability bias in online self-diagnosis. We investigated factors that distort self-assessment of symptoms after exposure to social media. We found that availability bias is pronounced when social media content resonated with individuals, making them disregard their own evidences. To address this, we developed and evaluated three chatbot-based symptom checkers designed to foster evidence-based self-reflection for bias mitigation given their potential to encourage thoughtful responses. Results showed that chatbot-based symptom checkers with cognitive intervention strategies mitigated the impact of availability bias in online self-diagnosis.",

The existing parental control tools fail to account for these differences, leaving a notable gap in the literature on parental mediation. To this end, we conducted 10 focus group sessions with a total of 20 parents to understand their preferences for age-appropriate design components that promote self-regulation and open communication, followed by an ideation workshop with four UX design experts to translate these preferences into customized features. We then evaluated these designs (presented as storyboards) through semi-structured interviews with 25 parents. Our study joins the body of work on parental mediation, providing valuable insights into customizing parental control settings as children transition through the developmental stages. Based on our findings, we offer guidelines for future research in these directions.",

We focus on deceptive “placebo” control settings for social media that do not work. While prior work reported that placebo controls increase feed satisfaction, we add to this body of knowledge by addressing possible placebo mechanisms, and potential side effects and confounds from the original study. Knowledge of these placebo mechanisms can help predict potential harms to users and prioritize the most problematic cases for regulators to pursue. In an online experiment, participants (N=762) browsed a Twitter feed with no control setting, a working control setting, or a placebo control setting. We found a placebo effect much smaller in magnitude than originally reported. This finding adds another objection to use of placebo controls in social media settings, while our methodology offers insights into finding confounds in placebo experiments in HCI.",

    "Abstract": "Healthy eating is essential to overall well-being. Deciding what and how to eat often requires collaboration and coordination with others to develop routines and create enjoyable experiences. However, life changes like moving or unemployment can disrupt food routines and social dining. Current technologies often overlook these evolving changes and do not adequately support individuals in collaborating with others to adapt to these impacts. In this paper, we interviewed 18 participants who experienced various routine changes during life events. Findings highlight the need for tools to support individuals in adapting to food practices, facilitating social coordination, and mediating conflicts during transitions. We explore design opportunities that facilitate technology reconfiguration, value clarification and mediation, and social coordination, aiming to better support individuals in times of change, both for those who undergo life events and others who offer help with food practices. Our work offers design considerations for technologies that enhance healthy eating and food service, ensuring sustained support during life changes.",

    "Abstract": "Eating disorders (ED) are complex mental health conditions that require long-term management and support. Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based chatbots offer the potential to assist individuals in receiving immediate support. Yet, concerns remain about their reliability and safety in sensitive contexts such as ED. We explore the opportunities and potential harms of using LLM-based chatbots for ED recovery. We observe the interactions between 26&nbsp;participants with ED and an LLM-based chatbot, WellnessBot, designed to support ED recovery, over 10 days. We discovered that our participants have felt empowered in recovery by discussing ED-related stories with the chatbot, which served as a personal yet social avenue. However, we also identified harmful chatbot responses, especially concerning individuals with ED, that went unnoticed partly due to participants’ unquestioning trust in the chatbot’s reliability. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for safe and effective LLM-based interventions in ED management.",

    "Abstract": "Queer Joy is conceptualised as a form of resistance to oppression by celebrating queerness in the face of adversity. This research aimed to centre queer joy and understand how it is expressed and may be facilitated in online spaces. To do this we conducted a survey with 100 UK participants who indicated they identified as LGBTQ+ on the online recruitment platform Prolific. We asked a series of open and closed questions in an online survey to investigate 1) what queer joy looks like on social media 2) how queer joy content is engaged with on social media 3) which platforms are perceived to facilitate queer joy and 4) how queer people protect their privacy online. The results suggested that to facilitate queer joy online, platforms should allow flexible self expression and community engagement, while allowing for granular control over privacy and the audience such content is shown to.",

    "Abstract": "We examine WhatsApp-based reselling practices adopted by small garment sellers in Surat, a textile city in India, as a response to the challenges posed by high commission costs, confusing dashboards, and restrictive rules of global e-commerce platforms. Through interviews and observations, we show how sellers use WhatsApp’s popularity to collaborate with women resellers and customers, enabling participation in online commerce bypassing e-commerce platforms. Using the lens of translation, we argue that WhatsApp functions as a tool and site of praxis for sellers who translate the complicated, standardized, and expensive processes of e-commerce platforms that are in English into multimodal, idiomatic, collaborative reselling practices. These are undertaken in regional languages on WhatsApp with the help of traders and women resellers economically benefiting everyone while delivering a personalized online shopping experience for customers. We discuss the politics of this translation, examining its impact on the design of e-commerce platforms while also shaping the discourse of reselling as an empowering pathway for women.",

    "Abstract": "Infinite scrolling on social media platforms is designed to encourage prolonged engagement, leading users to spend more time than desired, which can provoke negative emotions. Interventions to mitigate infinite scrolling have shown initial success, yet users become desensitized due to the lack of contextual relevance. Understanding how contextual factors influence intervention effectiveness remains underexplored. We conducted a 7-day user study (N=72) investigating how these contextual factors affect users’ reactance and responsiveness to interventions during infinite scrolling. Our study revealed an interplay, with contextual factors such as being at home, sleepiness, and valence playing significant roles in the intervention’s effectiveness. Low valence coupled with being at home slows down the responsiveness to interventions, and sleepiness lowers reactance towards interventions, increasing user acceptance of the intervention. Overall, our work contributes to a deeper understanding of user responses toward interventions and paves the way for developing more effective interventions during infinite scrolling.",

We conducted in-depth design interviews along participatory speculative activities around a utopian social media application with seven young trans participants to explore desirable and meaningful social media. Participants reported experiences of algorithmic and other forms of violence, and discussed frictions between safety and freedom as they described their embodied experiences of shifting spaces. We identify scale, commercialisation and automation as core issues, and challenge the potential of large-public, profile-centric social media spaces to support human flourishing. Drawing from aspects of social media participants consider desirable and meaningful, we discuss the idea of a shift towards interest-centric, community-oriented spaces that prioritise interactions based on solidarity over those based on identity.",

To date, the HCI community has not explored activists’ perspectives on future social media platforms. In interviews with 14 activists from an environmental and a queer-feminist movement in Germany, we identify activists’ needs and feature requests for future social media platforms. The key finding is that on- and offline safety is their main need. Based on this, we make concrete proposals to improve safety measures. Increased control over content presentation and tools to streamline activist workflows are also central to activists. We make concrete design and research recommendations on how social media platforms and the HCI community can contribute to improved safety and content presentation, and how activists themselves can reduce their workload.",

However, for people with complex communication needs, such as aphasia, there can be accessibility challenges. While accessibility research has largely focused on audiovisual media, little work has considered audio-media, particularly for users with complex communication needs. To address this gap, we undertook six co-design workshops with 10 people with aphasia to re-imagine access to audio-media. We uncover how our co-designers perceive audio-media as more than a tool, but a part of daily intimacies; shaping social relationships and contributing to therapeutic recovery. Through a Research-through-Design process culminating in one low-fidelity and three high-fidelity technology probes that embody novel accessibility interventions, our findings further challenge conventional approaches to audio-media accessibility and signal new directions for future design.",

While recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) technology can generate highly realistic speech in various languages and accents, many struggle with unintuitive or overly granular TTS interfaces. We propose simplifying TTS generation by allowing users to specify high-level context alongside their script. Our Wizard-of-Oz system, SpeakEasy, leverages user-provided context to inform and influence TTS output, enabling iterative refinement with high-level feedback. This approach was informed by two 8-subject formative studies: one examining content creators’ experiences with TTS, and the other drawing on effective strategies from voice actors. Our evaluation shows that participants using SpeakEasy were more successful in generating performances matching their personal standards, without requiring significantly more effort than leading industry interfaces.",

    "Abstract": "Between 2012 and 2014, Weibo used a novel crowdsourced user ‘committee’ system to make content moderation decisions. In it, user volunteers were randomly assigned to jury-like committees to vote and comment on whether reported content violated platform rules. The perceived legitimacy of similar systems has been studied in tightly controlled lab and survey experiments, but the causal effects of such jury-like moderation systems on user behavior in the real world have not been studied to the same extent. Leveraging random variation in Weibo case votes due to the assignment of more or less lenient ‘jurors’, we show that, on average, social sanctioning and norm-setting through committee votes was associated with a large but brief decline in reported users’ future posting of offensive terms. However, in line with prior work on the relative ineffectiveness of out-group sanctioning, we observe no such effect among women sanctioned by the largely male committees. This study advances our understanding of the effects of institutionalized social sanctioning on social media user behavior, and the promises and potential shortcomings of crowdsourced moderation systems.",

Through a qualitative approach involving interviews and focus group discussion sessions, we investigate the online experiences encountered by this population along with their protection and coping mechanisms. Our findings provide a nuanced portrayal of both the internal and external challenges faced by these users.

    "Abstract": "Social media has become a primary information source, with platforms evolving from text-based to multi-modal environments that include images and videos. While richer media modalities enhance user engagement, they also increase the spread and perceived credibility of misinformation. Most interventions to counter misinformation on social media are text-based, which may lack the persuasive power of richer modalities. This study explores whether the effectiveness of misinformation correction varies by modality, and if certain modalities of misinformation are better countered by a specific correction modality. We conducted a survey-based experiment where participants rated the credibility of misinformation tweets before and after exposure to corrections, across all combinations of text, images and video modalities. Our findings suggest that corrections are most effective when their modality richness matches that of the original misinformation. We discuss factors affecting the perceived credibility of corrections and offer strategies to optimise misinformation correction.",

While linguistic expertise is clearly needed to adequately moderate such content, we ask: What additional expertise is needed? Why and to what extent do experts disagree on what constitutes harmful content, and what is the best way to resolve these disagreements? What do social media platforms do instead? We examine these questions through a 4-month study with 7 experts labeling 340 X (formerly Twitter) posts, and by interviewing 15 commercial content moderators. We find in-depth cultural knowledge and dialects to be most important for accurate hate speech annotation – knowledge which social media platforms do not prioritize. Even amongst experts, disagreements are high (71%), dropping to 40% after deliberation meetings. Based on these results, we present 7 recommendations to improve hate speech annotation and moderation practices.",

    "Abstract": "Youth are particularly likely to encounter hateful internet content, which can severely impact their well-being. While most social media provide reporting mechanisms, in several countries, severe hateful content can alternatively be reported to law enforcement or dedicated reporting centers. However, in Germany, many youth never resort to reporting. While research in human-computer interaction has investigated adults’ views on platform-based reporting, youth perspectives and platform-independent alternatives have received little attention. By involving a diverse group of 47 German adolescents and young adults in eight focus group interviews, we investigate how youth-sensitive reporting systems for hateful content can be designed. We explore German youth’s reporting barriers, finding that on platforms, they feel particularly discouraged by deficient rule enforcement and feedback, while platform-independent alternatives are rather unknown and perceived as time-consuming and disruptive. We further elicit their requirements for platform-independent reporting tools and contribute with heuristics for designing youth-sensitive and inclusive reporting systems.",

Our analysis is based on qualitative longitudinal research carried out over ten years, involving a small group of participants in 2012, 2017, and 2022. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted using stimulated recall allowing for retrospection and reflection. Through this methodology, we trace the shifting perceptions of social media users, from initially embracing these platforms for quick, fun, and social activities, to later recognizing their potential intrusiveness and seeking strategies to manage their use. We outline three central trajectories that illustrate shifts in social media use across time: from public performance to private interaction, from producing to consuming and from fun to problematic. For HCI and social media studies, these findings underscore the need to prioritize user agency, ethical design practices, and longitudinal research endeavors to understand the evolving impacts of social media.",

We present the first study to explore the security advice landscape of low socioeconomic people in Pakistan. With 20 semi-structured interviews, we uncover how they learn and share security advice and what factors enable or limit their advice sharing. Our findings highlight that they heavily rely on community advice and intermediation to establish and maintain security-related practices (such as passwords). We uncover how shifting social environments shape advice dissemination, e.g., across different workplaces. Participants leverage their social structures to protect each other against threats that exploit their financial vulnerability and lack of digital literacy. However, we uncover barriers to social advice mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness, which may lead to increased security and privacy risks. Our results lay the foundation for rethinking security paradigms and advice for this vulnerable population.",

    "Name": "User Experiences with Abortion Misinformation on TikTok: Encounters, Assessment Strategies, and Response",
    "Abstract": "Studying health-related misinformation, so far, has mostly focused on general “fearmongering” content spread on social media. The Supreme Court’s overturn of Roe v. Wade highlighted the need to study abortion misinformation as health-related content that could have criminal implications for users. In response to this need, we conducted a study with 60 TikTok users about the way they conceptualize, assess, and respond to misleading abortion videos. Half of our participants saw political intent behind the spread of health-related misinformation driven towards a “fear of criminalization.” Prior to Roe v. Wade, our participants encountered videos discussing the legal ramifications of abortion, but post-Roe v. Wade, they saw videos suggesting herbal alternative treatments for pregnancy termination. Roughly 30% of our participants believed in the safety and efficacy of these otherwise scientifically debunked “alternative abortion treatments,” even in the presence of a debunking label attached to a self-administering abortion video.",

    "Abstract": "Location-based media applications such as Google Maps, Strava and Pokémon GO together have more than a billion monthly active users, and popular social media such as Snapchat and Instagram now also feature map-based content. All these media products rely on user-generated content as a core element of their service, but there is a lack of synthesis on the users’ motivations to contribute this data to the platform providers. In this study, we performed a literature review to uncover users’ motivations to participate in location-based crowdsourcing and contribute shared content on these platforms. Among our findings, we show that spatial and temporal aspects, social effects, technical elements, motivational mechanisms, practical value offered to the contributors and individual differences need to be considered in motivating users to contribute shared content. We present recommendations for designers, suggest which terminology to use around this topic and propose an agenda for future research.",

    "Abstract": "Content Warning: This paper presents textual examples that may be offensive or upsetting.Large language model-based AI companions are increasingly viewed by users as friends or romantic partners, leading to deep emotional bonds. However, they can generate biased, discriminatory, and harmful outputs. Recently, users are taking the initiative to address these harms and re-align AI companions. We introduce the concept of user-driven value alignment, where users actively identify, challenge, and attempt to correct AI outputs they perceive as harmful, aiming to guide the AI to better align with their values. We analyzed 77 social media posts about discriminatory AI statements and conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users. Our analysis revealed six common types of discriminatory statements perceived by users, how users make sense of those AI behaviors, and seven user-driven alignment strategies, such as gentle persuasion and anger expression. We discuss implications for supporting user-driven value alignment in future AI systems, where users and their communities have greater agency.",

Although academia has investigated the newly emerging Web3 social media, it is not clear how users perceive the usability of such platforms and how these perceptions are influenced by the inherent characteristics of Web3. To address this gap, we utilize affordance theory to explore the unique usability of Web3 social media compared with Web2 social media. We conducted interviews with 32 participants who are experienced with Web3 social media and examined the affordances of Web3 social media from the perspectives of content creation, content consumption, and community interaction. We further discuss the correlation between the usability of Web3 social media and the underlying decentralized technology, and provide design implications for enhancing the usability of this new type of social interaction platform.",

From providing relief to survivors of natural disasters, to addressing crises caused by societal failings like poverty, homelessness and unemployment, mutual aid is an important tool for community care and the development of new systems of survival. With mutual aid efforts increasingly entering the digital sphere, some work has investigated how the internet has transformed mutual aid, especially via social media. While such work describes mutual aid across a variety of contexts, we lack a broad understanding of how mutual aid principles translate online and the challenges organisers face in this digital landscape. To address this, we review 19 papers, identifying key characteristics, strategies, and challenges in online mutual aid. In doing so, we aim to enhance our understanding of how technology might foster sustainable community support and solidarity.",

    "Abstract": "Smartphone users often regret aspects of their phone use, especially social media use. However, pinpointing specific ways in which the design of an interface contributes to regrettable use can be challenging due to the complexity of social media app features and user intentions. We conducted a one-week study with 17 Android users, using a novel method where we passively collected screenshots every five seconds, which we analyzed via a multimodal large language model to understand participants’ usage activity at a fine-grained level. Triangulating this data with data from experience sampling, surveys, and interviews, we found that regret varies based on user intention, with non-intentional and social media use being especially regrettable. Regret also varies by social media activity; participants were most likely to regret viewing algorithmically recommended content and comments. Additionally, participants frequently deviated to browsing social media when their intention was direct communication, which slightly increased their regret. Our findings provide guidance to designers and policy-makers seeking to improve users’ experience and autonomy.",

Designing globally applicable content moderation systems requires considering historical, cultural, and socio-technical factors. Inspired by this line of work, we investigate Arab users’ perception of Facebook’s moderation practices. We collect a set of 448 deleted Arabic posts, and we ask Arab annotators to evaluate these posts based on (a) Facebook Community Standards (FBCS) and (b) their personal opinion. Each post was judged by 10 annotators to account for subjectivity. Our analysis shows a clear gap between the Arabs’ understanding of the FBCS and how Facebook implements these standards. The study highlights a need for discussion on the moderation guidelines on social media platforms about who decides the moderation guidelines, how these guidelines are interpreted, and how well they represent the views of marginalised user communities.",

However, little is known about what these processes look like on a moment-by-moment basis. We conducted a diary study to investigate how teens (N=57, Mage= 16.3 years) used Instagram to regulate their emotions. We identified three kinds of emotionally-salient drivers that brought teens to Instagram and two types of behaviors that impacted their emotional experiences on the platform. Teens described going to Instagram to escape, to engage, and to manage the demands of the platform. Once on Instagram, their primary behaviors consisted of mindless diversions and deliberate acts. Although teens reported many positive emotional responses, the variety, unpredictability, and habitual nature of their experiences revealed Instagram to be an unreliable tool for emotion regulation (ER). We present a model of teens’ ER processes on Instagram and offer design considerations for supporting adolescent emotion regulation.",

    "Name": "Why Can't Black Women Just Be?: Black Femme Content Creators Navigating Algorithmic Monoliths",
    "Abstract": "Content creation allows many online social media users to support themselves financially through creativity. The “creator economy” empowers individuals to create content (i.e. lifestyle, fitness, beauty) about their interests, hobbies and daily life. Social media platforms in turn moderate content (e.g., banning accounts, flagging and reporting videos) to create safer online communities. However, Black women, femme, and non-binary people content creators have seen their content disproportionately suppressed, thus limiting their success on the platform. In this paper, we investigate Black femme content creators’ (BFCC) theories about how their identities impact both how they create content and how that content is subsequently moderated. In our findings, we share the perceptions participants felt the algorithm constrains Black creators to. We build upon Critical Technocultural Discourse studies and algorithmic folk theories attributed to Black women and non-binary content creators to explore how Black joy can be prioritized online to resist algorithmic monoliths.",

    "Abstract": "Children’s increasing use of social video platforms like YouTube and TikTok raises safety concerns for parents, yet little research explores how they mediate their children’s social video consumption. Previous studies often treat online harms and benefits as outcomes of parental mediation, overlooking how these factors affect parental mediation or how these effects vary with parents’ self-efficacy. To address these gaps, we surveyed 285 parents and found that perceived content informativeness value and content-inherent harm increase mediation, while entertainment value and creator trustworthiness decrease it. Parents’ self-efficacy—digital literacy and confidence in understanding their children’s consumption—and children’s consumption frequency significantly moderate these effects. These findings lead us to discuss how parental mediation differs between traditional media and social video platforms, where parents perform a more complex benefit-harm analysis due to competing effects of perceived harms and benefits. We propose strategies for enhancing parents’ self-efficacy and platform-parent collaboration in children’s online safety.",

It has been suggested to be an effective framework for envisioning more ethical technology, yet previous work on virtue ethics and technology design has remained at theoretical recommendations. Therefore, we propose an approach for identifying user experience design patterns that embody particular virtues to more concretely articulate virtuous technology designs. As a proof of concept for our approach, we documented seven design patterns for social media that uphold the virtues of Catholic Social Teaching. We interviewed 24 technology researchers and industry practitioners to evaluate these patterns. We found that overall the patterns enact the virtues they were identified to embody; our participants valued that the patterns fostered intentional conversations and personal connections. We pave a path for technology professionals to incorporate diverse virtue traditions into the development of technologies that support human flourishing.",

The “votekick” system represents a democratized approach allowing all users to participate in moderation. Despite its widespread use in online gaming and social VR platforms, votekicking remains underexplored. This research studies how users use and perceive votekicking in VRChat, a leading social VR platform. Through thematic analysis of discussions from the Reddit community r/VRChat, our findings reveal that votekicking serves to cope with misconduct and enforce group-specific rules, but it also perpetuates toxicity such as materializing community-level biases. While praised for its immediacy and clear messaging against unacceptable behavior, votekicking’s effectiveness is hindered by its reactive nature, consensus challenges, and decision-making complexities. This research contributes to broader discussions on the limitations and advantages of direct community involvement in moderation and suggests practical design improvements to address the challenges associated with votekicking.",

Then, we propose a VR choreography creation system embedded with a context-aware choreography suggestion system and a choreography analysis system, all grounded in choreographers’ creative processes and mental models. Our study results demonstrated that ChoreoCraft fosters creativity, reduces memory dependency, and improves efficiency in choreography creation. Participants reported high satisfaction with the system’s ability to overcome creative plateaus and provide objective feedback.

However, its visual-centric design poses significant challenges for blind and low vision (BLV) viewers. Our formative study identified three primary challenges that hinder BLV viewers’ engagement with Danmu: the lack of visual context, the speech interference between comments and videos, and the disorganization of comments. To address these challenges, we present DanmuA11y, a system that makes Danmu accessible by transforming it into multi-viewer audio discussions. DanmuA11y incorporates three core features: (1) Augmenting Danmu with visual context, (2) Seamlessly integrating Danmu into videos, and (3) Presenting Danmu via multi-viewer discussions. Evaluation with twelve BLV viewers demonstrated that DanmuA11y significantly improved Danmu comprehension, provided smooth viewing experiences, and fostered social connections among viewers. We further highlight implications for enhancing commentary accessibility in video-based social media and live-streaming platforms.",

    "Abstract": "Displaying community fact-checks is a promising approach to reduce engagement with misinformation on social media. However, how users respond to misleading content emotionally after community fact-checks are displayed on posts is unclear. Here, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally analyze changes in sentiments and (moral) emotions in replies to misleading posts following the display of community fact-checks. Our evaluation is based on a large-scale panel dataset comprising N = 2225260 replies across 1841 source posts from X’s Community Notes platform. We find that informing users about falsehoods through community fact-checks significantly increases negativity (by 7.3%), anger (by 13.2%), disgust (by 4.7%), and moral outrage (by 16.0%) in the corresponding replies. These results indicate that users perceive spreading misinformation as a violation of social norms and that those who spread misinformation should expect negative reactions once their content is debunked. We derive important implications for the design of community-based fact-checking systems.",

Little research has explored the specific social needs and barriers that LGBT+ OAs face, particularly in online spaces. To address this gap, we conducted interviews with 10 LGBT+ OAs and an inclusive housing service provider. Our research highlights the importance of LGBT+ community engagement and digitally-supported social networks’ role for LGBT+ OAs. We identify challenges such as managing online identity, navigating LGBT+ social media apps and websites, as well as digital disconnectedness challenges among those with lower digital literacy. Recommendations include improving social platforms allowing LGBT+ OAs to manage selective identity characteristics, promoting genuineness and trust in LGBT+ platforms by employing tiered blocking and interest-driven connections, and non-digital outreach strategies for collaborations between LGBT+ organizations and senior centers to engage hidden and isolated LGBT+ OAs.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines how WhatsApp has evolved from a personal communication tool to a professional platform, focusing on its use by small business owners in India. Initially embraced in smaller, rural communities for its ease of use and familiarity, WhatsApp played a crucial role in local economies. However, as Meta introduced WhatsApp Business with new, formalized features, users encountered challenges in adapting to the more complex and costly platform. Interviews with 14 small business owners revealed that while they adapted creatively, they felt marginalized by the advanced tools. This research contributes to HCI literature by exploring the transition from personal to professional use and introduces the concept of Coercive Professionalization. It highlights how standardization by large tech companies affects marginalized users, exacerbating power imbalances and reinforcing digital colonialism, concluding with design implications for supporting community-based appropriations.",

    "Name": "A Comparative Study of How People With and Without ADHD Recognise and Avoid Dark Patterns on Social Media",
    "Abstract": "Dark patterns are deceptive strategies that recent work in human-computer interaction (HCI) has captured throughout digital domains, including social networking sites (SNSs). While research has identified difficulties among people to recognise dark patterns effectively, few studies consider vulnerable populations and their experience in this regard, including people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who may be especially susceptible to attention-grabbing tricks. Based on an interactive web study with 135 participants, we investigate SNS users' ability to recognise and avoid dark patterns by comparing results from participants with and without ADHD. In line with prior work, we noticed overall low recognition of dark patterns with no significant differences between the two groups. Yet, ADHD individuals were able to avoid specific dark patterns more often. Our results advance previous work by understanding dark patterns in a realistic environment and offer insights into their effect on vulnerable populations.",

    "Name": "Artificial Intimacy: Exploring Normativity and Personalization Through Fine-tuning LLM Chatbots",
    "Abstract": "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is one response to the critique of LLMs being biased, erasing diversity, and raising ethical concerns. The Artificial Intimacy project employs artistic methods, taking personalization of chatbots to an extreme by fine-tuning LLMs on individual social media data. We find that regular GPT-3 chatbots attempt to circumvent value-laden content through flagging prompts and producing generic non-answers with variable success. While the transactional nature of such output allowed participants to make sense of responses with less personification, fine-tuned models presented value-laden, normative, and familiar personalities, resulting in strong personification as a way of making sense of the interactions. This mimicry of emotional connection resulted in a sense of artificial intimacy creating expectations for reciprocity and consideration that the models cannot express by design. As the commercialization of interactions with chatbots continues, we discuss the ethics of such emotional manipulation and its implications for personalization of LLMs.",

    "Name": "Building a Better Social Media Platform: Can We Codesign With Equity in Mind?",
    "Abstract": "Adolescents are frequent users of social media, with research suggesting both potential harms and positive impacts from use. Black and Hispanic/Latinx youth in particular are both early adopters and high users of social media platforms. However, adolescents–and youth of color in particular–have relatively little say in the design of such platforms. We propose youth participatory action research (YPAR) as a model for informing co-design sessions with representatives of a social networking platform to develop community-building solutions and improve youth developmental outcomes. In a four-months-long study with Black and Hispanic/Latinx teens aged 14-17 (n = 14), we examined how their sense of engagement and efficacy were altered by actively leading, participating in and contributing to design exercises facilitated by Instagram, one of the world’s largest social media sites. Results of pre- and post- surveys indicated a significant increase in teens’ civic engagement as well as leadership efficacy. Our results contribute to the understanding of teenagers’ expectations and attitudes toward social media and how participatory methods for achieving equity in design can affect change. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

    "Name": "Beyond Visual Perception: Insights from Smartphone Interaction of Visually Impaired Users with Large Multimodal Models",
    "Abstract": "Large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled new AI-powered applications that help people with visual impairments (PVI) receive natural language descriptions of their surroundings through audible text. We investigated how this emerging paradigm of visual assistance transforms how PVI perform and manage their daily tasks. Moving beyond usability assessments, we examined both the capabilities and limitations of LMM-based tools in personal and social contexts, while exploring design implications for their future development. Through interviews with 14 visually impaired users of Be My AI (an LMM-based application) and analysis of its image descriptions from both study participants and social media platforms, we identified two key limitations. First, these systems’ context awareness suffers from hallucinations and misinterpretations of social contexts, styles, and human identities. Second, their intent-oriented capabilities often fail to grasp and act on users’ intentions. Based on these findings, we propose design strategies for improving both human-AI and AI-AI interactions, contributing to the development of more effective, interactive, and personalized assistive technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Self-disclosure, the sharing of personal and professional information about yourself, can help foster and maintain working relationships. But how do computers mediate the way we self-disclose at work? We look \"beyond the watercooler\" to investigate computer-mediated self-disclosure (CMSD) at work. We conducted two studies: (1) a survey (n=455 knowledge workers) to understand perceptions towards disclosing various information types among colleagues, and (2) an interview study (n=12 knowledge workers) with five speculative design concepts to characterize attitudes and needs around CMSD. Study 1 indicated sharing about well-being was valuable, but that it was less familiar among remote workers compared to those in-person or hybrid. Study 1 informed the design concepts for Study 2, whose findings revealed that CMSD is a key part of workers’ socialization and should evolve alongside relationship stages. We discuss design opportunities for adaptive, intentional, and personal CMSD, along with policy implications for organizations.",

    "Name": "Beyond Explicit and Implicit: How Users Provide Feedback to Shape Personalized Recommendation Content",
    "Abstract": "As personalized recommendation algorithms become integral to social media platforms, users are increasingly aware of their ability to influence recommendation content. However, limited research has explored how users provide feedback through their behaviors and platform mechanisms to shape the recommendation content. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 34 active users of algorithmic-driven social media platforms (e.g., Xiaohongshu, Douyin). In addition to explicit and implicit feedback, this study introduced intentional implicit feedback, highlighting the actions users intentionally took to refine recommendation content through perceived feedback mechanisms. Additionally, choices of feedback behaviors were found to align with specific purposes. Explicit feedback was primarily used for feed customization, while unintentional implicit feedback was more linked to content consumption. Intentional implicit feedback was employed for multiple purposes, particularly in increasing content diversity and improving recommendation relevance. This work underscores the user intention dimension in the explicit-implicit feedback dichotomy and offers insights for designing personalized recommendation feedback that better responds to users’ needs.",

    "Abstract": "In the digital information ecosystem, clicks serve as a crucial gateway to fact-checking, yet the essential challenge extends beyond this to fostering cognitive shifts that update entrenched false beliefs. This study investigates effective interventions aimed at encouraging users vulnerable to misinformation, particularly those who tend to avoid incongruent facts, to examine their false beliefs. We conducted an online experiment with 627 participants, comparing metacognitive and ranking interventions. Both interventions successfully improved click behavior, with the metacognitive intervention increasing belief-examining clicks by 14 percentage points and the ranking intervention by 33 percentage points. However, only the metacognitive intervention significantly promoted users’ examination of misinformation. This finding underscores the importance of interventions that go beyond merely influencing easily measurable clicks to facilitating thoughtful engagement with fact-checking content. We discuss implications for designing strategies to enhance online fact-checking engagement and mitigate misinformation’s societal impact.",

    "Name": "Autonomous Regulation of Social Media Use: Implications for Self-control, Well-Being, and UX",
    "Abstract": "Much work in HCI has investigated strategies for supporting autonomous self-regulation in social media use (SMU): helping users to control their time online and ensure it serves personally valued outcomes. However, results suggest that the effectiveness and acceptability of these strategies may vary based on individual needs. Recent work has attributed this variation to motivational factors, though we currently lack data to understand how these factors influence self-regulation, user experience and well-being. We draw on Self-Determination Theory to analyse autonomous and non-autonomous patterns of motivation in 521 users of social media. Using latent profile analysis, we identify 4 “motivational profiles” associated with significant differences in need satisfaction, affect, and compulsive engagement. Our results clarify distinct aspects of autonomy in SMU and identify opportunities to target and personalise design interventions; they suggest autonomous regulation can be associated with better experience and well-being, though not necessarily less time online.",
